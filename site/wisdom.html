That is the level known as <b>wisdom</b>.</p><p>To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of <b>simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust</b>.</p><q>There are two wisdoms: the first inclines to <a href='action.html'>action</a>, the second to <a href='inaction.html'>inaction</a>.</q><h5>—Stanislaw Lem, Cyberiada</h5><h3>five rings</h3><ul><li>Think of what is right and true.</li><li>Practice and cultivate the sciences.</li><li>Become acquainted with the arts.</li><li>Know the principles of the crafts.</li><li>Understand the harm and benefit in every thing.</li><li>Work to see every thing clearly.</li><li>Pay attention to subtleties.</li><li>Be careful even in small matters.</li><li>Don't do anything useless.</li></ul><h2><a href='action.html'>action</a></h2><h4>A collection of notes in regard to Action.</h4><p><b>Ahimsa</b>, or <i>Cause no injury, do no harm</i>, is a Buddhist concept referred to as nonviolence, and it applies to all living beings — <a href='vegan.html'>including all animals</a>.</p><q>Be mindful of impermanence.<br /> Be careful of idleness.</q><h3>action wisdom</h3><ul><li>Control of actions and speech to avoid unwholesome actions.</li><li>Effort to work as much as possible for the good of others, even at the risk of one's life.</li><li>Decision to devote oneself to beneficial actions and to remain steadfast on it.</li><li>Maintaining a state of mind turned to the happiness of others, to practise love for all beings without exception.</li><li>Development of knowledge and understanding through study and analytical reflection.

Not to follow any particular idea. Maintaining the mind in equanimity.</li></ul><h2><a href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>marvelous pursuit</a></h2><h4>The marvelous pursuit is an attempt to find paths out of alienation, by refusing to conceive of human action as divisible into the physical and the mental.</h4><p>The marvelous pursuit is born from the desire to create playful complexity in a desert of simplistic convenience. A hobby is a form of consumption, the marvelous pursuit on the other hand, is a rejection of <a href='commodity.html'>commodified convenience</a>, it can't be bought because it has no price. A marvelous pursuit refuses socially ascribed use. People learn such socially useless things as the names of fern and the grammar of dead languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to them on TV.</p><p>Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces. The marvelous pursuit often creates complexity but a complexity which is opposed to that of the technician. The <i>master</i> of a marvelous pursuit can never be an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society (and therefore to capital).</p><p>The value in marvelous pursuits lies in their self-creation which evades both use-value and exchange value.</p><p>Hobbies are forms of alienated leisure, compartmentalized parts of one’s life, past-times whose purpose is to fill our time with countable accomplishments and enjoyments.</p><p><i>Last update on <a href='tracker.html'>12V05</a>, edited 5 times. +31/22fh <b>orphan</b></i> <code style='float:right; font-size:80%'>--|||-</code></p></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> &copy; 2021 &mdash; <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
