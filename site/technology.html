<p>We indulge in the continual debasement of our attention and energy, get emotionally giddy as its squandered to the ignorant masses.

<p>The social media user does not post for enjoyment, they enjoy the indulgent masochism of its dopamine exhaustion, they indulge in it as they do a deep autumn depression, with an unconsciously mechanical action which draws them from their potential as a Being.

<p>If we are surrounded by life, why is the universe silent? Shouldn’t the whole universe be a noisy social media feed, everyone vying for everyone else’s attention?

<p>I asked one Amish person why they didn’t use automobiles. He simply smiled and turned to me and said, “Look what they did to your society.” And I asked what do you mean? “Well, do you know your neighbor? Do you know the names of your neighbors?” And, at the time, I had to admit to the fact that I didn’t.</p>

<p>And he pointed out that my ability to simply bypass them with the windows closed meant I didn’t have to talk to them. And as a result, I didn’t.</p>

<p><b>The end of work</b> is the upcoming abstraction and machine automation of mostly all that is currently understood as work. Inside capitalism, the critical moment is specifically where technology meets capital: who gets to own this <i>capital</i>; the "factory without the worker".</p>

<p>The end of work, or <i>the end of jobs</i>, is an immediate <a href='collapse.html'>reality</a>. For most, who are currently subsisting through participation in the wage labour system, this is also end of getting paid and able to "not die". The idea that <i>for every job at the bottom closed by technology, there's one opening at the top</i> is ridiculous.</p>

<q>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country, dividing logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a precise fraction of the state's profit.</q>

<p>The state did not appreciate the journeymen's associations' tendency to <a href='sabotage.html'>strike</a>, nor their ability to move as they pleased when work conditions were unfavorable. The state's response was to take over the management of the construction sites, merging all the divisions of labor together in the supreme distinction between the intellectual and the manual, the theoretical and the practical.</p>

<p>By separating intellectual and physical labor the state took power away from both types of workers. The manual laborers could then only build what others had planned and the planners no longer had the capacity to build anything at all.</p>

<p>The dark forest theory of the internet outlines automated dynamics tied to communication. We describe our thoughts incessantly, in detail. But this legibility means that our coordinates are exposed. We can be seen, attacked, and governed. The more detailed our descriptions are, the easier we are to govern. The more we are seen, the easier for us to become a target.</p>

	<li><b>Paradox of tolerance</b>: States that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.</li>
	<li><b>The Veil Of Ignorance</b>: Behind this veil, you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities, position in society, sex, race, nationality, or individual tastes. All individuals are simply specified as rational, free, and morally equal beings.</li>
	<li><b>Behavioral sink</b>: A term used to describe the collapse in behavior(stress, alienation, hostility, sexual perversion, parental incompetence, and rabid violence) which resulted from overcrowdedness in an experiment on mice, drawing parallels with societal collapse found in the human Megalopolis.</li>
	<li><b>Dunbar's Number</b>: A suggested cognitive limit of 150, to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.</li>
	<li><b>Kessler syndrome</b>: A theoretical scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.</li>

<p>Lauderdale pointed out that the only way to increase <i>private riches</i> was to reduce what he called <i>public wealth</i>, or the commons.  To enclose things that were once free so that people have to pay in order to access them. To illustrate, he noted that colonialists would often even burn down trees that produced nuts and fruits so that local inhabitants wouldn't be able to live off of the natural abundance of the earth, but would be forced to work for wages in order to feed themselves.</p>

<h2>For when the whole vast world of men shall be — By waters ruined, ye'll wail a dreadful song.</h2>

<p><i>I, the Monster, am doing the thinking, run toward the destiny I have planned for you, run without stopping to the end of the road where I have put the Bomb or the complete degradation of humanity — we're almost there, run with your eyes closed, it's easier, shout all together Justice — Patriotism — Progress — Intelligence — Dignity — Civilization.</i></p>

<p><i>What, you aren't running — you're sailing around on your boat, just to think! and you dare complain into your tape recorder saying what you have in your heart just wait, you poor fool, I'm going to shoot you down in flames guys who get angry and speak out are very dangerous for me, I have to shut them up if too many of them started getting angry, I wouldn't be able to drive the human cattle as I please, their eyes and ears blocked by Pride, Stupidity and Cowardice and I'm in a hurry to get them, bleating and satisfied, where I want them to go.</i></p>

<p>And I know all that is no <a href='simulacra.html'>dream</a>, everything beautiful and good that men have done they built with their dreams but back there, the Monster has taken over for men, it dreams in our place. It would have us believe that man is the centre of the universe, that all rights are his on the pretense that he invented the steam engine and lots of other machines, and that he will someday reach the stars if he just hurries a little before the next bomb.</p>

<p>The modern progress economy dealt in technological potential and progress, whereas the postmodern innovation economy dealt in windows of opportunity that open and close.

No one cares about what your <a href='technology.html'>technology</a> does; we care about what problems it solves for users, and how fast you can grow. </p>

<p>Production and the ideals of production have been so <a href='technocracy.html'>successful</a>, that a new stage is reached, a stage that has a certain banality or triviality where the ideal disappears and becomes so commonplace that it does not have meaning associated with it.</p>

<p>When one weighed material comforts against something as ineffable, and unpriceable, as integrity, standing up for one's beliefs could seem like a utopian gesture — a moral luxury that was <i>admirable</i>, perhaps, but quite pointless.</p>

<p>Because to tell the truth, nothing happens anymore. Nothing any longer has the time to happen. There is no duration left for anything to unfold in. Nothing can anchor itself in the world long enough to make sense. While the present still has a duration, the hyperpresent no longer does.</p>

<h2>We live in a time of social, economic and ecological unravelling. All around us are signs that our way of living is already passing into history.</h2>

<p>Collapse is the transition away from a globalized, hyperconnected and materially-abundant society, toward a state of greater precariousness, lesser abundance, potentially reaching a stage of existential risk for our species. </p>

<p>At the peak of the <i>Seneca Cliff</i>, the curve that describes the rapid phase transitions of complex systems on the basis of the principle that "growth is sluggish, but ruin is rapid."

<p><i>Hope</i>, while once a useful trait, is what has condemned us, because we literally cannot see the cliff as we dance off it. Instead of celebrating the failed audacity of hope, it might be prudent to contemplate, in the time we have left, the paucity of hope - because the most we can realistically hope for, trapped by forgone conclusions, is to vanquish fear and find the grace of acceptance.</p>

<h3>Rate of Collapse</h3>
<table border='1'>
	<tr>
		<th>Rapid</th>
		<td>Collapse will happen rapidly on a global scale within a narrow timeframe. Lots of small local infrastructure failures, political instabilities, or extreme weather events will prevent a gradual transition.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Linear</th>
		<td>Collapse will occur slowly and globally. Global infrastructure and production chains will be increasingly harder to maintain. Many nation-states and local communities will see their material conditions deteriorate over the years. Although this will lead to a reduction in population and welfare, the gradual transition will allow for adaptation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Non-Linear</th>
		<td>Due to ecological and infrastructural cross-dependencies, there will be a breaking point where several different and converging forces will be triggered. These will accelerate collapse before a stable situation is reached. This rate of change may be too rapid for humans to adapt to effectively.</td>
	</tr>

		<td><b>Deniers</b>: there are no downward trends, climatic or ecological threats. The present order is not subject to threats of historic magnitude or capable of experiences compromised  material and social well-being. Examples: Koch Brothers, Exxon, Clintel</td>
		<td><b>Defeatists</b>: the collapse is inevitable because we should have acted earlier. Now any technical and political solution is superfluous.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Technological Optimists</b>: collapse is possible, but it is a technical problem that can be solved. In particular, new technologies in the ecological, energetic, and digital field will be able to reverse the phenomena we are observing. </td>
		<td><b>Delayers</b>: collapse is inevitable and the primary goal is to slow it down in order to extend current conditions as much as possible, making it easier to get through the collapse, and to minimize the cost in terms of human lives.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Reformists</b>: collapse will be prevented by deep restructuring of the production system, welfare, and huge investments in ecological remediation. There will be a political tipping point due to the damage caused by the approaching collapse and the resistance of nation-states to act and protect the status quo. When that happens, sufficient forces will be released for radical interventions.</td>
		<td><b>Post-collapsists</b>: the collapse is inevitable and therefore we must act now to build conceptual, technical, and social tools that will serve us during and after the collapse in order to minimize long-term consequences.</td>

	<li><b>Uncivilisation</b>: It is to accept the world for what it is and to make our home here, rather than dreaming of relocating to the stars, or existing in a Man-forged bubble and pretending to ourselves that there is nothing outside it to which we have any connection at all.</li>
	<li><b>Dark Mountaineers</b>: Artists who generally ascribe to the idea that climate collapse cannot be stopped or reversed, a forum in which one can be honest about their sense of dread and loss.</li>
	<li><b>Anthropocene</b>: A proposed epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change.</li>
	<li><b>Simple pastoral</b>: Merely another of our many vehicles of escape from reality, that doesn’t interrogate civilisation's main driving forces, but instead focuses on returning to rural simplicity.</li>
	<li><b>Freudian death drive</b>: The hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state.</li>
	<li><b>Existential Risk</b>: An event that could cause human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanity's potential.</li>
	<li><b>Albedo Effect</b>: Warming caused by the disappearance of ice which previously reflect heat back into space.</li>
	<li><b>Fossil Capitalism</b>: A theory suggesting the modern economy is actually just a system that runs on fossil fuel.</li>
	<li><b>Tragedy of the Commons</b>: A situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action.</li>
	<li><b>Age of Salvage</b>: When a civilization breaks down, the most efficient economies are most often those that use its remains as raw material.</li>
	<li><b>Cornucopianism</b>: Crackpot optimism, hopium.</li>
	<li><b>Drawdown</b>: Stealing resources from the future.</li>
	<li><b>Creeping normalcy</b>: How gradual changes can be accepted as the normal situation if these changes happen slowly, or incrementally.</li>
	<li><b>Wishcycling</b>: Where people are hoping that something is recyclable and therefore they put it in with their recycling.</li>
	<li><b>The Jackpot</b>: The mundane cataclysm of modernity itself. It is hundreds of millions of people driving to the supermarket in their SUVs, flying six times a year, and eating medicated animals for dinner.</li>

<h2>Imagine that software development becomes so complex and expensive that no software is being written anymore, only apps designed in devtools.</h2>

<p>Imagine a computer, which requires 1 billion transistors to flicker the cursor on the screen. Imagine a world, where computers are driven by software written from 400 million lines of source code.</p>

<p>Imagine a world, where the biggest 20 technology corporation totaling 2 million employees and 100 billion USD revenue groups up to introduce a new standard. And they are unable to write even a compiler within 15 years.</p>

<q>This is our <a href='technocracy.html'>current world</a>.</q>
<p>I firmly believe the <a href='technology.html'>Internet</a>, and what it stood for, peaked with RSS. Having only the content I want to see only be shown when I want to see it with the freedom to jump between readers as I please, all with no ads? For me, no other service comes close to the flexibility, robustness, and overall ease-of-use that RSS offers. <a href='https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>In mainstream computing, "ease of use" is usually implemented as "superficial simplicity" or "pseudo-simplicity", i.e. as an additional layer of complexity that hides the underlying layers. Meanwhile, systems that are actually very simple and elegant are often presented in ways that make them look complex to laypeople</p>

<p>I always told people that the thing computers are best at is adding unwanted complexity. If I am in a room full of computer professionals I think I am in a room full of people who mostly make their living dealing with computer fat. If you ask that room full of people what their companies do what will they say:</p>

<p>We sell software to clean up the garbage left behind by your programs. We sell software to deal with the growing complexity of your software. We just keep selling bigger upgrades to our product. We sell a bigger CPU. We sell bigger memories. We sell a service solving people's upgrade problems. We sell PCs to people who don't need them. <a href='http://www.ultratechnology.com/lowfat.htm' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<q>The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair.</q>
