People need more than to be made to feel stupid and guilty. They need more than a vision of <a href='collapse.html'>doom</a>. They need a vision of the world and of themselves that <a href='adaptation.html'>inspires</a> them.</p><img src='../media/refs/wrench.jpg' width='200'/>&nbsp;<p>There is nothing new, everything has been done, all philosophic and social theoretical issues have been addressed, and all that is left is to recycle, recombine, and play with these in new ways. </p><q>The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilisation.</q><h5>—Ralph Waldo Emerson</h5><p>We will face this reality honestly and learn how to live with it. We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of problems in need of <a href='technology.html'>technological</a> or political solutions. We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in the stories we have been telling ourselves.</p><h2><a href='anarchy.html'>anarchy</a></h2><h4>Anarchy means not necessarily the absence of order but an absence of rule.</h4><p>Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, ableism, speciesism, and religion. </p><p>Anarchists wish to create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation. Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.</p><p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.</p><p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price — except at the price of liberty.</p><p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.</p><img src='../media/refs/opa.png'/>&nbsp;<q>The individual cannot bargain with the State.

In recent decades, by the process of looking(instead of merely assuming), ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the community as a whole.</p><p>This system of laws has been called, among other things, the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and <a href='vegan.html'>animal ethics</a>.</p><h3>altap links</h3><ul><li><a href='https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com'>Low Tech</a></li><li><a href='http://criticalengineering.org'>CE Manifesto</a></li><li><a href='https://deepresource.wordpress.com'>Deep Resource</a></li><li><a href='http://www.designlife-cycle.com'>Design Lifecycle</a></li><li><a href='https://openstructures.net'>Open Structures</a></li><li><a href='http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange'>What Can A Technologist</a></li><li><a href='https://www.notechmagazine.com'>No Tech</a></li><li><a href='https://simplifier.neocities.org'>Simplifier</a></li><li><a href='https://wiki.opensourceecology.org'>Open Source Ecology</a></li><li><a href='https://lowtechlab.org'>Low Tech Lab</a></li><li><a href='https://spacebuckets.com'>Space Buckets</a></li><li><a href='https://www.instructables.com/Indoor-Moss-Microbial-Fuel-Cell'>Moss Electricity</a></li><li><a href='http://solarprotocol.net'>Solar Protocol</a></li><li><a href='https://www.siteations.com/courses/designresearch2014/readings/wk01/Thwaites_ToasterProject.pdf'>Toaster From Scratch</a></li></ul><img src='../media/refs/bosai.png' style='float:left;margin-right:15px;width:90px'/><p>Green skills are the knowledge and abilities needed to develop and support a sustainable and resource-efficient society, such as recycling, permaculture gardening, sustainable food production, ecological construction, maintenance and renovation.</p><h3>adaptation</h3><ul><li><b>Strong Longtermism</b>: The primary determinant of the value of our actions is the effects of those actions on the very long-run future.</li><li><b>The Hinge of History Hypothesis</b>: The hypothese that we are living at the most influential time ever.</li><li><b>Carbon Capture</b>: A technological negative emissions solution that aims to remove carbon from the air, storing it as inert material.

Laugh.</q><h2><a href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>marvelous pursuit</a></h2><h4>The marvelous pursuit is an attempt to find paths out of alienation, by refusing to conceive of human action as divisible into the physical and the mental.</h4><p>The marvelous pursuit is born from the desire to create playful complexity in a desert of simplistic convenience. A hobby is a form of consumption, the marvelous pursuit on the other hand, is a rejection of <a href='commodity.html'>commodified convenience</a>, it can't be bought because it has no price. A marvelous pursuit refuses socially ascribed use. People learn such socially useless things as the names of fern and the grammar of dead languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to them on TV.</p><p>Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces. The marvelous pursuit often creates complexity but a complexity which is opposed to that of the technician. The <i>master</i> of a marvelous pursuit can never be an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society (and therefore to capital).</p><p>The value in marvelous pursuits lies in their self-creation which evades both use-value and exchange value.</p><h2><a href='solarpunk.html'>solarpunk</a></h2><h4>Sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy.</h4><p>A technophilic movement centered on using and being affected by the use of renewable resources, recycling and <a href='adaptation.html'>repurposing</a> with a focus on decentralisation, community activism, social justice and civic empowerment. A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.</p><p>Embracing approachable, human-scale, or <i>knowable</i>, technology and envisioning a world in which the detritus of <a href='commodity.html'>consumer culture</a> is appropriated and repurposed toward the reconstruction of a devastated ecology.</p><p>Permaculture is the science and practice of creating semi-permanent ecosystems of nature. The resilience of any such ecosystem is equal to it's diversity + interconnectedness. Permaculture design is a system of assembling conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to benefit life in all its forms. It seeks to provide a sustainable and secure place for living things on this earth.</p><h2><a href='vegan.html'>vegan</a></h2><h4>A way of living which seeks to prevent all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, other animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.</h4><p>Specisism is discrimination on the basis of species, oppression and judgment of an animal on the basis of that animal's species or that animal's non-membership in a species. The belief in <a href='adaptation.html'>human superiority</a> over other animals or certain nonhuman animals' superiority over others.</p><p>Animal Rights is the position that the interests of nonhuman animals, including their interest in not suffering, should be afforded the same consideration as the interests of humans and that nonhuman animals have rights and inherent value independent of their us. </p><h3>animal rights</h3><ul><li><b>Animal Liberation Front</b>: An international, leaderless resistance that engages in removing animals from laboratories and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses and veterinary care, and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live.</li><li><b>Animal Advocacy</b>: Promotion of the interests of animals, generally.
