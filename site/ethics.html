We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of problems in need of <a href='technology.html'>technological</a> or political solutions. We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in the stories we have been telling ourselves.</p><p>We're destroying the world because we are, in a very literal and deliberate way, at war with it.

The belief in <a href='adaptation.html'>human superiority</a> over other animals or certain nonhuman animals' superiority over others.</p><p>Animal Rights is the position that the interests of nonhuman animals, including their interest in not suffering, should be afforded the same consideration as the interests of humans and that nonhuman animals have rights and inherent value independent of their us. </p><h3>animal rights</h3><ul><li><b>Animal Liberation Front</b>: An international, leaderless resistance that engages in removing animals from laboratories and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses and veterinary care, and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live.</li><li><b>Animal Advocacy</b>: Promotion of the interests of animals, generally. Includes work for animal rights and animal welfare.</li><li><b>Commodification</b>: The conversion of a living being, principle, or natural environment into an "object" that is used, exchanged, or consumed for profit or other desired gain.</li><li><b>Debarking</b>: The surgical removal and manipulation of tissue in a dog's vocal cords to drastically quiet his or her natural bark. Debarking does not address the underlying reasons that a dog may be barking excessively, and the dog will continue to bark, albeit more quietly or silently.</li><li><b>Draize Test</b>: Infamous and excruciating eye-irritation test for household products and cosmetics in which drops of a substance are placed in the eyes of rabbits, causing the animals ulcers, blindness, and other injuries before they are ultimately killed.</li><li><b>Flowerpot Technique</b>: A technique used in sleep deprivation studies designed to allow NREM sleep but prevent REM sleep.</li><li><b>Forced Molting</b>: The egg-industry practice of artificially inducing hens to molt by depriving them of food for several days to two weeks when their egg production has declined.</li><li><b>Rape Rack</b>: The industry term referring to the contraptions in which cows and pigs are restrained while they are forcibly inseminated.</li><li><b>Veal Crate</b>: Small crate in which a calf being raised for veal is confined and tied up.

Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.</p><p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.</p><p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price — except at the price of liberty.</p><p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.</p><img src='../media/refs/opa.png'/>&nbsp;<q>The individual cannot bargain with the State.
