<p>In lieu of doing the Advent of Code, I aim to do a little bit of software programming every day in December. Possibly implement a handful of <a href='https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/' target='_blank'>fun X11 software</a> to Uxntal, improve existing roms and document the daily progress.</p>

<p><code>01 DEC</code> Completed the design of the panel for <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/blinkengenie' target='_blank'>Blinkenlights</a>. This little Uxn emulator includes a knob to change the evaluation rate, a stepper and a button to start the program over.</p>

<p><code>02 DEC</code> Added a much needed 8x8 zoom grid to <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, which will make it a lot easier to do quick alterations to 1-bit tilesets .</p>

<p><code>03 DEC</code> Created a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/moth' target='_blank'>little calendar application</a> which has been a wonderful exercise in learning about the routines needed in finding the day in the week of a given date, finding the number of days a month, and finding the number of days in a year.</p>

<p><code>04 DEC</code> Transformed the little calendar program, into a kind of virtual whiteboard onto which I can scribble notes overlaying the calendar. It records each month's drawings as icn files, making it possible to edit them with <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>.</p>

<p><code>05 DEC</code> It's a busy day aboard <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> today, so I couldn't pick as large a task as with the previous days, so I've decided to make my pixelart life slightly more pleasant by adding a selection size label to remove some of the guess work in <a href='nasu.html'>Nasu</a>.</p>

<p><code>06 DEC</code> I decided to repurpose the emulator at the core of <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/blinkengenie' target='_blank'>Blinkenlights</a>, and turn it into something that would be more practical. Inspired from Uxn32's Beetbug, I've made a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/beetbug' target='_blank'>stand-alone debugger</a> that works on all emulators and allow anyone to step through their program.</p>

<p><code>07 DEC</code> I realized that I might have built something invaluable yesterday with the native implementation of <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>, I've spent my morning adding controller input and breakpoints to this little rom which will now be part of my permanent collection of utilities.</p>

<p><code>08 DEC</code> I wanted to push this little debugger further yet, but to do so, I had to make <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a> write a symbol file, and Beetbug read it. The running program's instructions are now addorned by little labels from the assembly file.</p>

<p><code>09 DEC</code> Unfortunately, I do not have a screenshot to show for today's software project but I did draw a big turnip, so. So you'll have to take my words for it, taking the <a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> implementation detail, with the help of <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/@tbsp@mastodon.social/109485726882862393' target='_blank'>@tbsp</a>, I've added symbols output to uxnasm. Next step will be to add support symbols in the error reporting of uxncli and uxnemu, something for tomorrow.</p>

<p><code>10 DEC</code> The day went by very fast indeed, between Uxn ending up on the front-page of <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33926600' target='_blank'>Hackernews</a>, and answering the emails that ensued, compounded by the release of a most incredible implementation of a <a href='https://github.com/tbsp/varaboy' target='_blank'>Gameboy emulator</a> for Varavara, it was soon noon and I had to resume the rewiring of the boat. But, before the day was over, I managed to sneak in a few improvements to <a href='dexe.html'>Dexe</a> which I have been using daily.</p>

<p><code>11 DEC</code> I had some projects I wanted to do today, at least I think I did, but I found a nasty bug in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnlin' target='_blank'>uxnlin</a> that really annoyed me, to the point that I dropped whatever it was I was doing and spent the whole morning fixing it.</p>

<p><code>12 DEC</code> I implemented <a href='metadata.html'>metadata</a> to <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, and added 1-bit sprite-copying to <a href='nasu.html'>Nasu</a>, so I can pull assets without having to manually erase the extra color channel.</p>

<p><code>13 DEC</code> I've implemented a limited version of the calendar routine I wrote at the start of the month, into <a href='potato.html'>Potato</a>!</p>
