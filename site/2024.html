	<h2>2024-03-10 Left revamp</h2>
	<p>We took the chainplates off and while the new ones are being fabricated, we
reinforced the area where the chainplate meet the deck. It makes for a
momentarily uninhabitable place to live, so I haven't had much headspace to do
creative work these past few days, but it will be well worth it considering the
places we're hoping to venture into.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Made a few improvements to <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/left' target='_blank'>Left</a>'s support for UTF-8.</li>
		<li>Rewrote the <a href='../etc/uxnrepl/src/uxn.js' target='_blank'>uxn.js</a>, it now passes the opcode tests.</li>
		<li>Added <a href='https://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Example%20programs' target='_blank'>example programs</a> to the concat wiki.</li>

	<h2>2024-02-25 Hello, Dot?</h2>
	<p>Our plans for the summer are coming into focus. It looks like we'll depart
early, head as far north as we can make it, and see if the boat and its crew
can weather the cold. This ought to give us taste of what we might expect would
we decide to make it further into the arctic next year.</p>
	<p>Someone found an interesting undefined behavior in the assembly of Uxn code,
where the <a href='uxntal_scope.html'>nesting of child labels</a> could be
implemented in one of two ways, leading to an incompatiblity between
assemblers. I've explored this further and found myself pulled me into a
concatenative object-oriented programming rabbit-hole.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Released <a href='potato.html'>Potato</a>, added to <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn' target='_blank'>uxnemu</a> and <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11' target='_blank'>uxn11</a> emulators.</li>
		<li>Added <a href='utf8.html'>Latin Accented</a> support to <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed reading Bosun Bird's <a href='https://www.bosunbird.com/beyond-the-rapids' target='_blank'>sailing beyond the rapids</a>.</li>

	<h2>2024-02-11 Conlang Weekly</h2>
	<p>Other than <a href='https://100r.co/site/boat_projects.html' target='_blank'>doing improvements aboard</a>, it has been a month of playing with conlangs and conscripts. I begun
exploring <a href='utf8.html'>variable length glyphs</a> in <a
href='left.html'>Left</a> after adding support for the Lambda(λ) character
last month, and went further still by supporting the <a
href='shavian.html'>Shavian alphabet</a>. I had been looking for an alternative
alphabet for a while and loved its 48 letters, the symmetries in the glyphs and
how easy it was to <a href='https://shavian.school' target='_blank'>learn
it</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Added a dark mode to the wiki.</li>
		<li>Dodo soldosisol <a href='solresol.html#numbers'>larelafa solmisimi</a>.</li>

	<h2>2024-01-26 Back to music</h2>
	<p>I've originally started looking into virtual machines to build a target to
host some games, a handful of tools and my wiki &mdash; but instead of stopping
once I had done so, I kept pushing further and became obsessed with this
programming language design stuff, and along the way, I lost track of why I was
even doing it all in the first place. After a two year detour, I look back and
I've almost totally ignored my other interests as a digital artist and
musician. It's about time I find my way back. </p>

	<h2>2024-01-13 Maintenance</h2>
	<p>The forge that we use at Hundred Rabbits has been <a
href='https://status.sr.ht' target='_blank'>taken down by DDoS attacks</a> and
is struggling to come back online, the event reminded us that we ought to also
have mirrors and release versions of these source files available elsewhere. I've begun
to host copies across our various websites. The builds are still
accessible through <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io'
target='_blank'>itch.io</a>.</p>
	<p>Until we regain access and release the changes of the last few days, keeping
with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use I've taken a
moment to write a kind of <i>pocket version</i> of the console emulator and <a
href='drifblim.html'>self-hosted assembler</a> as to see how many lines are
needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket
emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have
been <a href='uxn.html'>added to the wiki</a>.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, if anyone is looking for a specific file that is currently
unavailable, get in touch!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Revamped the <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a> page.</li>
		<li>Enjoyed watching the mini series <a href='https://archive.org/details/effondrement-collapse-2019'>L'Effondrement(2019)</a>.</li>
		<li>Thankful for Sourcehut's tireless work on <a href='https://status.sr.ht' target='_blank'>resolving the issue and communication</a>.</li>
