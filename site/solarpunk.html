<p>Solarpunk is movement centered on using and being affected by the use of renewable resources with a focus on decentralisation, community activism, social justice and civic empowerment. A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.</p>

<p>Embracing approachable, <a href='permacomputing.html'>personal technology</a> and envisioning a world in which the detritus of <a href='commodity.html'>consumer culture</a> is appropriated and repurposed toward the reconstruction of a devastated ecology.</p>

<p>Permaculture is the science and practice of creating semi-permanent ecosystems of nature. The resilience of any such ecosystem is equal to it's diversity + interconnectedness. Permaculture design is a system of assembling conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to benefit life in all its forms. It seeks to provide a sustainable and secure place for living things on this earth.</p>

<p>Punk is a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It manifests through <a href='sabotage.html'>direct action</a>, such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades, squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and business property destruction.</p>

<q>The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilisation.</q>
<h5>—Ralph Waldo Emerson</h5>

<p>Solarpunk is also a reaction to the cynical and dystopian imaginaries that have come out of the fear of climate change. It is a way of tackling ecoanxieties and an invitation to complement the important work of climate scientists. Just as climate scientists have sought to warn the world about the dangers of climate change, Solarpunks are offering alternative visions to the helplessness often generated by such warnings.</p>

<p>We're destroying the world because we are, in a very literal and deliberate way, at war with it. People need more than to be made to feel stupid and guilty. They need more than a vision of <a href='collapse.html'>doom</a>. They need a vision of the world and of themselves that <b>inspires them</b>.</p>

<p>Green skills are the knowledge and abilities needed to develop and support a sustainable and resource-efficient society, such as recycling, permaculture gardening, sustainable food production, ecological construction, maintenance and renovation.</p>
<h2>An environmental philosophy which promotes the inherent worth of all living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.</h2>

<h3>deep ecology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The well-being of human and nonhuman life on earth is of intrinsic value irrespective of its value to humans.</li>
	<li>The diversity of life-forms is part of this value.</li>
	<li>Humans have no right to reduce this diversity except to satisfy vital human needs</li>
	<li>The flourishing of human and nonhuman life is compatible with a substantial decrease in human population.</li>
	<li>Humans have interfered with nature to a critical level already, and interference is worsening.</li>
	<li>Policies must be changed, affecting current economic, technological and ideological structures.</li>
	<li>This ideological change should focus on an appreciation of the quality of life rather than adhering to an increasingly high standard of living.</li>
	<li>All those who agree with the above tenets have an obligation to implement them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from permaculture.</h2>

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements for computing even the most trivial tasks. Permacomputing aims at only using computing when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems.</p>

<img src="../media/refs/solaris.jpg"/>

<p>Permacomputing does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating a dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenunity to finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition into co-operation and <a href='solarpunk.html'>waste into resources</a>.</p>

<p>It values maintenance and encourages programmers to refactor and rewrite programs to keep them small and efficient, instead of counting on Moore's law to compensate for <a href='stack.html'>software bloat</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>, permacomputing practices planned <a href='longtermism.html'>longevity</a>, reuse and repair of existing technology and approaches waste as a resource.</p>

<p>Rustic Computing refers to the construction of calculation machines using pre-industrial or even pre-historic technology. It reveals a history of computing as the pastime of dilettantes, amateur scientists and tabulators who construct machines to manipulate abstract symbols with no practical application.  As these machines are generally less efficient than conventional pencil and paper computation, they allude to a more epicurean practice of computing for pleasure rather than production.<a href='https://moddr.net/rustic-computing/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>"What is the most suitable programming language for permacomputing?", is akin to asking what is the most suitable plant for permaculture – the entire question contradicts itself.</p>
