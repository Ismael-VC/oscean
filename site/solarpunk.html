<p>A technophilic movement centered on using and being affected by the use of renewable resources, recycling and <a href='adaptation.html'>repurposing</a> with a focus on decentralisation, community activism, social justice and civic empowerment. A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.</p>

<p>Embracing approachable, <a href='permacomputing.html'>personal technology</a> and envisioning a world in which the detritus of <a href='commodity.html'>consumer culture</a> is appropriated and repurposed toward the reconstruction of a devastated ecology.</p>

<p>Permaculture is the science and practice of creating semi-permanent ecosystems of nature. The resilience of any such ecosystem is equal to it's diversity + interconnectedness. Permaculture design is a system of assembling conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to benefit life in all its forms. It seeks to provide a sustainable and secure place for living things on this earth.</p>

<p>Punk is a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It manifests through <a href='sabotage.html'>direct action</a>, such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades, squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and business property destruction.</p>

<p>Solarpunk is also a reaction to the cynical and dystopian imaginaries that have come out of the fear of climate change. It is a way of tackling ecoanxieties and an invitation to complement the important work of climate scientists. Just as climate scientists have sought to warn the world about the dangers of climate change, Solarpunks are offering alternative visions to the helplessness often generated by such warnings.</p>
<h2>An environmental philosophy which promotes the inherent worth of all living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.</h2>


<h3>deep ecology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The well-being of human and nonhuman life on earth is of intrinsic value irrespective of its value to humans.</li>
	<li>The diversity of life-forms is part of this value.</li>
	<li>Humans have no right to reduce this diversity except to satisfy vital human needs</li>
	<li>The flourishing of human and nonhuman life is compatible with a substantial decrease in human population.</li>
	<li>Humans have interfered with nature to a critical level already, and interference is worsening.</li>
	<li>Policies must be changed, affecting current economic, technological and ideological structures.</li>
	<li>This ideological change should focus on an appreciation of the quality of life rather than adhering to an increasingly high standard of living.</li>
	<li>All those who agree with the above tenets have an obligation to implement them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collapse now and avoid the rush.</h2>

<p>Collapse won't be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning off the <a href='technology.html'>air-conditioning</a>. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one: understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront this problem, and the sooner we realize thereâ€™s nothing we can do to save ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal humility, to our <a href='collapse.html'>new reality</a>.</p>


<img src='../media/refs/fahrenheit451.jpg'/>

<p>The <b>myth of progress</b> tells us that we are destined for greatness, that we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called 'nature', which we have now triumphantly subdued.</p>

<p>During the <b>Great Forgetting</b>, it came to be understood among the people of our culture that life in <i>the wild</i> was governed by a single, cruel law known as "kill or be killed." In recent decades, by the process of looking(instead of merely assuming), ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the community as a whole.</p>

<p>This system of laws has been called, among other things, the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and <a href='vegan.html'>animal ethics</a>.</p>


<h3>adaptation</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Strong Longtermism</b>: The primary determinant of the value of our actions is the effects of those actions on the very long-run future.</li>
	<li><b>The Hinge of History Hypothesis</b>: The hypothese that we are living at the most influential time ever.</li>
	<li><b>Carbon Capture</b>: A technological negative emissions solution that aims to remove carbon from the air, storing it as inert material. Small units exist at high cost, and it remains unclear whether large scale deployment is possible or desirable.</li>
	<li><b>Carbon Budget</b>: An attempt to provide the world with a means of tracking emissions with goals set based on projected temperature rise. Most models are not believed to accurately account for feedback loops.</li>
	<li><b>Solar Radiation Management</b>: Methods of reducing global temperature by increasing albedo, frequently discussed methods include stratospheric sulphur injection and marine cloud brightening.</li>
	<li><b>Scientific Reticence</b>: A phenomenon where scientists failed to emphasize many the more dramatic results of the study of global warming over concerns of reception.</li>
	<li><b>Coppicing</b>: A method of harvesting wood without killing trees, which exploits the capacity of many species of trees to grown new shoots from their stump or roots if cut down.</li>
	<li><b>Electronics right to repair</b>: A government legislation intended to allow consumers the ability to repair and modify their own electronics, where otherwise the manufacturer of such devices require the consumer to use only their offered services.</li>
</ul>
<q>Expect the end of the world. Laugh.</q>

<p>Green skills are the knowledge and abilities needed to develop and support a sustainable and resource-efficient society, such as recycling, permaculture gardening, sustainable food production, ecological construction, maintenance and renovation.</p>


<h3>regenerative sustainability</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Integrity</b>: Maintaining the wholeness of wider systems, ensuring that structure and relationships remain intact and functioning as they should.</li>
	<li><b>Inclusivity</b>: Interacting with the world in its entirety, engaging and integrating with all dimensions, levels of existence and knowledge.</li>
	<li><b>Harmony</b>: All elements cooperate through relationships that are respectful in order to avoid dissonance.</li>
	<li><b>Respect</b>: All parts of the world have intrinsic worth and all existence is part of the extended self, and therefore all self-respect is extended to mutual respect for the world.</li>
	<li><b>Mutuality</b>: Compassion, treating others the same as yourself.</li>
	<li><b>Positive reciprocity</b>: Reciprocating in a way that is of benefit to and advances the relationship between self and extended self.</li>
	<li><b>Fellowship</b>: An extension of mutuality and positive reciprocity, where the world is co-created by humans in partnership with nature.</li>
	<li><b>Responsibility</b>: Morally accountability for the consequences of our actions in an uncertain and unpredictable world.</li>
	<li><b>Humility</b>: Change is constant, we cannot know the true consequences of our actions.</li>
	<li><b>Non-attachment</b>: In order to adapt to changing circumstances it is important to uphold non-attachment in order to decouple from the futility of trying to hold onto anything in an ever changing world including ideas, dogmas and strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from permaculture.</h2>

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements for computing even the most trivial tasks.</p>

<img src="../media/refs/solaris.jpg"/>

<p>Permacomputing does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating a dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenunity to finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition into co-operation and <a href='adaptation.html'>waste into resources</a>.</p>

<p>It values maintenance and encourages programmers to refactor and rewrite programs to keep them small and efficient, instead of counting on Moore's law to compensate for <a href='stack.html'>software bloat</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>, permacomputing practices planned <a href='longtermism.html'>longevity</a>, reuse and repair of existing technology and approaches waste as a resource.</p>

<p>Rustic Computing refers to the construction of calculation machines using pre-industrial or even pre-historic technology. It reveals a history of computing as the pastime of dilettantes, amateur scientists and tabulators who construct machines to manipulate abstract symbols with no practical application.  As these machines are generally less efficient than conventional pencil and paper computation, they allude to a more epicurean practice of computing for pleasure rather than production.<a href='https://moddr.net/rustic-computing/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p>"What is the most suitable programming language for permacomputing?", is akin to asking what is the most suitable plant for permaculture â€“ the entire question contradicts itself.</p>
