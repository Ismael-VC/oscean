The resilience of any such ecosystem is equal to it's diversity + interconnectedness. Permaculture design is a system of assembling conceptual, material and strategic components in a pattern which functions to benefit life in all its forms. It seeks to provide a sustainable and secure place for living things on this earth.</p><p>Punk is a rejection of mainstream, corporate mass culture and its values. It manifests through direct action, such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, ecotage, street barricades, squatting, pirate radio, off-grid energy, graffiti, vandalism and public and business property destruction.</p><h2><a href='adaptation.html'>adaptation</a></h2><h4>Collapse now and avoid the rush.</h4><p>The <b>myth of progress</b> tells us that we are destined for greatness, that we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called 'nature', which we have now triumphantly subdued.</p><p>During the <b>Great Forgetting</b>, it came to be understood among the people of our culture that life in <i>the wild</i> was governed by a single, cruel law known as "kill or be killed." In recent decades, by the process of looking(instead of merely assuming), ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the community as a whole.</p><p>This system of laws has been called, among other things, the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and <a href='vegan.html'>animal ethics</a>.</p><img src='../media/refs/bosai.png' style='float:left;margin-right:15px;width:90px'/><p>Green skills are the knowledge and abilities needed to develop and support a sustainable and resource-efficient society, such as recycling, permaculture gardening, sustainable food production, ecological construction, maintenance and renovation.</p><h3>adaptation</h3><ul><li><b>Strong Longtermism</b>: The primary determinant of the value of our actions is the effects of those actions on the very long-run future.</li><li><b>The Hinge of History Hypothesis</b>: The hypothese that we are living at the most influential time ever.</li><li><b>Carbon Capture</b>: A technological negative emissions solution that aims to remove carbon from the air, storing it as inert material.
