<p><code>16J</code> ; I've been exploring <a href='logic.html'>combinatory logic</a>, as we make our way north toward Desolation Sound and the Broughton Archipelago. I'm endlessly fascinated by how an entire computing paradigm can emerge from these basic primitives.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Created a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/ornithologics' target='_blank'>birdwatching playground</a> to observe as these talking birds knot the void into functions.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16I</code> ; Aquired twelve <a href='slide_rule.html'>slide rules</a> and figured out how to use them, my plan is to give them as gift to people we meet. I've spent the better part of the week plotting shapes on paper with the help of the slide rule. Meanwhile, I've also written a little <a href="turquoise.html">line-plotting engine</a> for creating procedural graphics, and a <a href="nebu.html">spreadsheet program</a> to help me organize some data.</p>

<p><code>16H</code> ; I felt frustrated by the development of Uxn this week. I was thinking back on the creation of <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, especially about the period when the last few operators were being finalized. A handful of livecoders and myself were already using it as the remaining rough edges were still being figured out. I recall people in the chatroom who would raise hell each time operators were moved around. Looking back, I'm glad that I didn't freeze the specs then, or Orca would not have its current operators and symmetries, I had to remind myself of that.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn5" target="_blank">HTML5 implementation</a> of UxnVM.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16G</code> ; Inspired from the <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2015004_cuneiform.pdf" target="_blank">Cuneiform Tablets</a> paper, I considered realizing the paper's point of implementing <a href='https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/989' target="_blank">Smalltalk72</a> on a UVM, I spent a few days experimenting with the ST72 environment &mdash; Only to realize that, like the <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~rabbits/b23e80eaf675c1b704bc704577e503cfd0d8f474" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a>, it is poorly thought out and fundamentally irreconcilable with <i>smol computing</i>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a plain <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11" target="_blank">X11 implementation</a> of Varvara.</li>
	<li>Created an Uxntal REPL, called <a href='bicycle.html'>Varvara's Bicycle</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16F</code> ; We gave our talk at <a href='https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/libreplanet-living-liberation-day-two-retrospective-and-motivation-for-freedom' target="_blank">LibrePlanet 2022</a>, and it went very well. During the Q&A, we talked about living without a fridge, from food preservation to <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sprouting.html' target="_blank">sprouting</a>, and we were delighted to see so many people interested in that stuff. I guess the intersection of computers and gardens is slightly larger than I thought. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Played a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1eC8czDAkk' target="_blank">little set</a> for Algorave's 10th anniversary.</li>
	<li>Revamped Orca, Nasu, and Left to support Varvara's new Screen/Auto port.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16E</code> ; Took a deep dive into the various experiments in digital preservation(PADI, CAMiLEON, Domesday, etc..), didn't really find anything worthy of note, but it did inspire me to rewrite some of the content on <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a>. I've also spent the past couple of days improving <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, and adding support for <a href="tga_format.html">tga</a> images.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/turing.gif' width="300" />

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a little single-file Uxntal assembler called <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16D</code> ; Rekka is putting the finishing touches to the <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a> novel, and asked me to design a game that the people of Iridi could be playing. I thought a dice game combining the capture mechanism of Go and the randomness of the Domino draw might be a good fit, learn to play <a href='hako.html'>Hako</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBTzswUmzY' target='_blank'>J & Y wiring</a>, in the Uxn port of Orca.</li>
	<li>Wrote a version of <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/minesweeper' target='_blank'>minesweeper</a> for Varvara.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16C</code> ; Our upcoming keynote for <a href='https://www.fsf.org/news/artist-collective-hundred-rabbits-to-keynote-libreplanet-living-liberation' target='_blank'>Libre Planet 2022</a> has been announced, we've built a little <a href='adelie.html'>slideshow program</a> for the presentation. I've revamped the <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> documentation and added a <a href='orca_reference.html'>reference page</a>, as well as fixing a few bugs in the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy' target='_blank'>Uxntal implementation</a>. Toying with wireworld sucked much of my time, again.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added incoming links to Oscean.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16B</code> ; Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a Serbian and Polish translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/wireworld' target="_blank">wireworld</a>. Ah! Also, <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> turned one year old.</p>

<img src="../media/generic/uxn.cake.png" width="250">

<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the Uxn project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>second one</a> is about a personal computer and the last one will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>
