	<p><code>16M</code> ; I hate to think that we will, at some point, have to sail south to re-supply, we've both decided that we shall stretch our supplies for as long as we possibly can. We will soon run out of fresh produce, but we have prepared enough <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/lactofermentation.html' target='_blank'>preserves</a> to last us for months.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote our keynote for <a href='https://nime2022.org/' target='_blank'>NIME 2022</a>.</li>
	<li>Transcribed notes over to the <a href='https://permacomputing.net' target='_blank'>Permacomputing Wiki</a>.</li>
	<li>Planted wheat, barley and mustard greens at 50°8.409'N 124°56.842'W</li>
	<li>Planted soy at 50°8.549'N 124°56.972'W</li>

	<p><code>16L</code> ; We've arrived in Desolation Sound and met up with friends. We spend the long afternoons rowing the dinghy along the shoreline and exploring the thickly forested coast. I went ahead and assigned a glyph to each Uxn opcode, to make an <a href='uxntal_alphabet.html'>Uxntal Alphabet</a>, it adds a wonderful conlang aspect to the project. I'm hoping to turn this into a little graphical assembler at some point.</p>

	<h1>2022-06-01</h1>
	<p><code>16K</code> ; I just couldn't stop thinking about a potential <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>Uxntal Sign Language</a>. So, Rekka and I began assigning hand gestures to numbers, operators and modes. I'm also thinking that I might like to assign glyphs so an assembler that does away with English altogether could be envisioned.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnlin' target='_blank'>linter</a> for Uxntal, and implemented <a href='https://wiki.c2.com/?TailCallOptimization' target='_blank'>tail-call optimization</a> to uxnasm.</li>
	<li>Planted lentils, mung beans and radishes at 50°8.527'N 124°40.195'W</li>

	<h1>2022-05-30</h1>
	<p><code>16J</code> ; We are finally making our way north toward Desolation Sound and the Broughton Archipelago. We are spending these late spring days anchored between high mountains, revisiting ideas for projects we had concieved of this last winter, but decided to leave for a later time. I've been fascinated by how an entire computing paradigm can emerge from the primitives of combinatory logics, my recent thoughts have been populated by these <a href='logic.html'>strange talking birds</a>.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented an <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/ornithologics' target='_blank'>ornithologics</a> playground.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h1>2022-05-14</h1>
	<p><code>16I</code> ; Aquired a couple of <a href='slide_rule.html'>slide rules</a> from a retired teacher, and figured out how to use them, my plan is to gift them to people we meet in our travels. I've spent the better part of the week plotting shapes on paper with the help of the slide rule, while also experimenting with a <a href="turquoise.html">line-plotting engine</a>, inspired from <i>Turtle Graphics</i>, for creating procedural graphics.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Released a <a href='nebu.html'>spreadsheet program</a>, which fits neatly in a 6kb rom.</li>
	<li>Wrote a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn5" target="_blank">HTML5 implementation</a> of UxnVM.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h1>2022-04-30</h1>
	<p><code>16H</code> ; I felt frustrated by the development of Uxn this week. I was thinking back on the creation of Orca, especially about the period when the last few operators were being finalized. A handful of livecoders and myself were already using it as the remaining rough edges were still being figured out. I recall people in the chatroom who would raise hell each time operators were moved around. Looking back, I'm glad that I didn't freeze the specs then, or Orca would not have its current operators and symmetries, I had to remind myself of that.</p>

	<h1>2022-04-14</h1>
	<p><code>16G</code> ; Inspired from the <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2015004_cuneiform.pdf" target="_blank">Cuneiform Tablets</a> paper, I considered realizing the paper's point of implementing <a href='https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/989' target="_blank">Smalltalk72</a> on a UVM, I spent a few days experimenting with the ST72 environment &mdash; Only to realize that, like the <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~rabbits/b23e80eaf675c1b704bc704577e503cfd0d8f474" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a>, it is poorly thought out and fundamentally irreconcilable with <i>smol computing</i>.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a plain <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11" target="_blank">X11 implementation</a> of Varvara.</li>
	<li>Created an Uxntal REPL, called <a href='bicycle.html'>Varvara's Bicycle</a>.</li>
</ul>

	<p><code>16F</code> ; We gave our talk at <a href='https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/libreplanet-living-liberation-day-two-retrospective-and-motivation-for-freedom' target="_blank">LibrePlanet 2022</a>, and it went very well. During the Q&A, we talked about living without a fridge, from food preservation to <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sprouting.html' target="_blank">sprouting</a>, and we were delighted to see so many people interested in that stuff. I guess the intersection of computers and gardens is slightly larger than I thought. </p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Played a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1eC8czDAkk' target="_blank">little set</a> for Algorave's 10th anniversary.</li>
	<li>Revamped Orca, Nasu, and Left to support Varvara's new Screen/Auto port.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h1>2022-03-14</h1>
	<p><code>16E</code> ; Took a deep dive into the various experiments in digital preservation(PADI, CAMiLEON, Domesday, etc..), didn't really find anything worthy of note, but it did inspire me to rewrite some of the content on <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a>. I've also spent the past couple of days improving <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, and adding support for <a href="tga_format.html">tga</a> images.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a little single-file Uxntal assembler called <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h1>2022-02-30</h1>
	<p><code>16D</code> ; Rekka is putting the finishing touches to the <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a> novel, and asked me to design a game that the people of Iridi could be playing. I thought a dice game combining the capture mechanism of Go and the randomness of the Domino draw might be a good fit, learn to play <a href='hako.html'>Hako</a>.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBTzswUmzY' target='_blank'>J & Y wiring</a>, in the Uxn port of Orca.</li>
	<li>Wrote a version of <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/minesweeper' target='_blank'>minesweeper</a> for Varvara.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h1>2022-02-14</h1>
	<p><code>16C</code> ; Our upcoming keynote for <a href='https://www.fsf.org/news/artist-collective-hundred-rabbits-to-keynote-libreplanet-living-liberation' target='_blank'>Libre Planet 2022</a> has been announced, we've built a little <a href='adelie.html'>slideshow program</a> for the presentation. I've revamped the <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> documentation and added a <a href='orca_reference.html'>reference page</a>, as well as fixing a few bugs in the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy' target='_blank'>Uxntal implementation</a>. Toying with wireworld sucked much of my time, again.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Finally, brought back incoming links at the bottom of wiki pages. They had been gone since the migration from C, to Uxntal.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h1>2022-01-30</h1>
	<p><code>16B</code> ; Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a Serbian and Polish translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/wireworld' target="_blank">wireworld</a>. Ah! Also, <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> turned one year old.</p>

	<h1>2022-01-14</h1>
	<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the Uxn project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>second one</a> is about a personal computer and the last one will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>
