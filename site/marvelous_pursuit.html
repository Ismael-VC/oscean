<p>The marvelous pursuit is born from the desire to create playful complexity in a desert of simplistic convenience. A hobby is a form of consumption, the marvelous pursuit on the other hand, is a rejection of <a href='commodity.html'>commodified convenience</a>, it can't be bought because it has no price. A marvelous pursuit refuses socially ascribed use. People learn such socially useless things as the names of fern and the grammar of dead languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to them on TV.</p>

<p>Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces. The marvelous pursuit often creates complexity but a complexity which is opposed to that of the technician. The <i>master</i> of a marvelous pursuit can never be an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society (and therefore to capital).</p>

<p>The value in marvelous pursuits lies in their self-creation which evades both use-value and exchange value.</p>

<p>Hobbies are forms of <a href='simulacra.html'>alienated leisure</a>, compartmentalized parts of one's life, past-times whose purpose is to fill our time with countable accomplishments and enjoyments.</p>

<p>Rustic Computing refers to the construction of calculation machines using pre-industrial or even pre-historic technology. It reveals a history of computing as the pastime of dilettantes, amateur scientists and tabulators who construct machines to manipulate abstract symbols with no practical application.  As these machines are generally less efficient than conventional pencil and paper computation, they allude to a more epicurean practice of computing for pleasure rather than production.</p>
