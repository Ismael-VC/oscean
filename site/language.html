<p>Welcome to the <b>Language Portal</b>, the goal of these pages is to host a few resources, summaries and notes from my own language studies. I've moved all notes about programming languages <a href='programming.html'>here</a>, and math things <a href='arithmetic.html'>here</a>. Additional notes can be found in the <a href='notebook.html'>notebook</a>.</p>

<h3>principles of learning</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Space learning over time</b>:  Spaced schedules of studying and testing produce better long-term retention than a single study session or test.</li>
	<li><b>Worked example solutions problem solving exercises</b>:  Presenting the students step-by-step solutions to problems should be intermixed with having the students solve the problems by themselves.</li>
	<li><b>Combine graphics with verbal descriptions</b>:  Materials presented in verbal, visual and multimedia form are richer representations than those with a single modality or medium.</li>
	<li><b>Abstract and concrete representations of concepts</b>:  An understanding of an abstract concept improves with multiple and varied concrete examples.</li>
	<li><b>Use quizzing to promote learning</b>: Testing enhances learning, particularly when the tests are aligned with important content.</li>
	<li><b>Help students allocate study time effectively</b>: Students need to allocate more time on difficult material and to have repeated practice for some concepts and skills. Outlining, integrating and synthesizing information produces better learning than re-reading materials or other more passive strategies.</li>
	<li><b>Ask deep explanatory questions</b>: Students benefit more from asking and answering deep questions that elicit explanations (e.g., why, why not, how, what if) than shallow questions (e.g., who, what, when, where).</li>
	<li><b>Contiguity</b>: Ideas that need to be associated should be presented contiguously in space and time.</li>
	<li><b>Perceptual-motor grounding</b>: Students learn better when teachers link concepts to concrete perceptual motor experiences, particularly at early stages of learning.</li>
	<li><b>Generation effect</b>: Learning is better when learners actively produce answers, rather than merely recognize answers as in multiple-choice questions.</li>
	<li><b>Stories and example cases</b>: Learners tend to remember stories and example cases better than didactic facts and abstract principles.</li>
	<li><b>Feedback</b>: Students benefit from feedback on their performance in a learning task, with the timing depending on the task. Learning incorrect information can be reduced when students are given immediate feedback.</li>
	<li><b>Manageable cognitive load</b>: Learning materials should not overload working memory.</li>
	<li><b>Cognitive disequilibrium</b>: Deep reasoning and learning is stimulated by problems that create cognitive disequilibrium, such as obstacles to goals, contradictions, conflict and anomalies.</li>
	<li><b>Cognitive flexibility</b>: Students’ cognitive flexibility improves when they are presented with multiple viewpoints that link facts, skills, procedures and deep conceptual principles.</li>
	<li><b>Goldilocks principle</b>: Assignments should not be too hard or too easy, but at the right level of difficulty for each student’s skill and prior knowledge.</li>
	<li><b>Anchored learning</b>: Learning is deeper and students are more motivated when the materials and skills are anchored in real-world problems that matter to the learner.</li>
</ul>

<h3>dictionary</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Anthropomorphism</b>: Attributing distinctly human characteristics to nonhuman processes.</li>
	<li><b>Antifragile</b>: Some things benefit from shocks, they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, stressors, risk, and uncertainty.</li>
	<li><b>Parsimony</b>: Refers to the quality of economy or frugality in the use of resources.</li>
	<li><b>Lateralus</b>: The affliction of illusion of inescapable cyclicality. Example: The failure to recognize one's growth, inability to dream of unprecedented things, ceding to self-reinforcing systems, being jaded to hope, waiting for nonexistent chickens to hatch from nonexistent eggs.</li>
	<li><b>Rationality</b>: Characteristic of thinking and acting optimally.</li>
	<li><b>Epistemology</b>: A theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope, and the distinction between justified belief and opinion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>linguistics</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Gematria</b>: A cipher that assigns numerical value to a word, name, or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other.</li>
	<li><b>Palindrome</b>: A word, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward.</li>
	<li><b>Ambigram</b>: A word, art form or other symbolic representation whose elements retain meaning when viewed or interpreted from a different direction, perspective, or orientation.</li>
	<li><b>Leitmotif</b>: A short, constantly recurring musical phrase associated with a particular person, place, or idea.</li>
	<li><b>Asemic</b>: A wordless open semantic form of writing. The word asemic means "having no specific semantic content", or "without the smallest unit of meaning".</li>
