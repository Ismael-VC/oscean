<p>Early computers were designed from the ground up to be truly general purpose. When you turned them on, you'd be presented with the word <code>READY</code>, and a blinking cursor. It was an open invitation to PROGRAM the machine! This is no mere appliance, it's a beckoning gateway to intellectual discovery!</p>

<h2>Imagine a computer harnessing the natural behavior of natural systems and utilizing their behaviors to solve equations.</h2>

<p>Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Engine' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<h3>Color Computer</h3>

<p>Non-electronic computers that work when you color them according to a simple set of rules. The booklet contains three series of computers: computers that compare, computers that count, and computers that play. From a technical standpoint they are all NOR-based logic circuits designed by using truth tables, karnaugh maps, and maxterm expansions. </p>

<p>From a social, political, and environmental perspective, these computers are an exploration of computation without electricity and semiconductors, an attempt to reinvent digital systems away from efficiency and productivity, and a hopeful prototype to expose the inner workings of computers.<a href='https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYz7DPRWypGQcbAHr7Mi8EKB6ntSPsEnUsCXbAhBiHQZP/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<h3>Nomograms</h3>

<p>A nomogram is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a function. Each variable is marked along a scale, and a line drawn through known scale values (or a straightedge placed across them) will cross the value of the unknown variable on its scale. See also, <a href='slide_rule.html'>slide rules</a>.</p>

<h3>Visual Multiplication</h3>

<p>The stick method of multiplication involves properly placing and crossing sticks. You simply lay out sticks consistent with the place values of the digits being multiplied. Then, you count the places where the sticks cross. <br />Example: 62 x 21 = 1302</p>

<img src='../media/refs/sticks.jpg' width='240' />

<h3>Lattice Multiplication</h3>

<p>Lattice multiplication is a method of multiplication that uses a lattice to multiply two multi-digit numbers. <br />Example: 64 x 17 = 1088</p>

<h3>Genaille-Lucas Rods</h3>

<p>The right side of the triangle covers the unit digits of a partial product added to a possible carry from the right. The left corner of the triangle is placed in height corresponding to the tens figure of the partial product. Multiplication is done by arranging the rods for the numbers needed, then following the arrows from right to left to read out the result. </p>

<h3>Paper Microfluidics</h3>

<p>Fluidics is the construction of computing systems using fluids. Paper microfluidics donâ€™t require external pumps or power sources, they can be small, portable, disposable, easy to distribute and operate, low-cost, technically simple to make, and they only need tiny amounts of sample fluid. A minimal setup can be as simple as heating the lines drawn by wax crayon on extra absorbent paper, like cellulose paper and using droplets with food colouring.</p>

<h2>Interaction nets are a graphical model of computation.</h2>

<p><b>Interaction nets</b> can capture all computable functions with rewriting rules, no external machinery such as copying a chunk of memory, or a garbage collector, is needed. Unlike models such as Turing machines, Lambda calculus, cellular automata, or <a href='logic.html'>combinators</a>, an interaction net computational step can be defined as a constant time operation, and the model allows for parallelism in which many steps can take place at the same time.</p>

<h3 id='agents'>1. Agents</h3>

<p>An <b>agent</b>(<i>a</i>) is a cell that has one <i>principal port</i> and a number of <b>auxiliary ports</b>(<i>n</i>). A pair of agents connected together on their principal ports is called an <i>active pair</i>. Graphically, principal ports are distinguished by arrows.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/in_cell.png' width='350'/>

<p>The examples on this page will make use of four agents: <b>Successor</b>(increments a natural number), <b>Zero</b>, <b>Add</b> & <b>Mul</b>.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/in_ari.png' width='475'/>

<h3 id='nets'>2. Interaction Nets</h3>

<p>A <b>net</b> is a graph of agents where each port is connected to another one by means of a <b>wire</b>. The following net has three free ports, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>. Note that a wire may connect two ports of the same agent. A rewriting of a net is performed only on an active pair according to an <a href='#rules'>interaction rule</a>.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/in_net.png' width='300'/>

<h3 id='rules'>3. Rewriting Rules</h3>

<p>Here, <i>rewriting</i> is just a convenient word to express a very concrete notion of <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uIGQ1biCXY' target='_blank'>interaction</a>, which we shall make precise by requiring some properties of rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Agents interact only through their principal port.</li>
	<li>Each variable in a rule occurs exactly twice, once on each side.</li>
	<li>There is at most one rule for each pair of distinct symbols.</li>
</ul>

<p>In an agent definition, the first port is the principal port,  the rest of the ports are listed in the order obtained by moving anticlockwise round the agent. The following definition follows the interaction net at the left side of the <a href='../media/refs/in_add_rule2.png'>rule 2 figure</a>.</p>

<pre>
<b>Net:</b>
	Add(u,y,z), S(u,x)
</pre>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Rule 1</th>
		<th>Rule 2</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src='../media/refs/in_add_rule1.png' width='350'/></td>
		<td><img src='../media/refs/in_add_rule2.png' width='350'/></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>In the following notation, an interaction rule consists of a pair of net descriptions separated by an arrow. Agents are capitalized, and free ports are lowercase.</p>

<pre>
<b>Rules:</b>
	Add(u,y,z), Z(u)   --> z-y
	Add(u,y,z), S(u,x) --> S(z,w), Add(x,y,w)
</pre>

<p>From now on, we will use <a href='https://github.com/inpla/inpla' target='_blank'>Inpla</a>'s notation for rules in which the principal ports are taken out of the brackets and their equivalent connection written as <kbd>&gt;&lt;</kbd>. When an agent has an arity of 0, the brackets are removed altogether. Thus, we can write the entire addition program as:</p>

<pre>
add(y, z) >< Z => y~z;
add(y, z) >< S(x) => add(y, S(z))~x;
add(res,S(Z))~S(S(Z));
res;
</pre>

<p>An interaction net to compute the result of 1 + 1 with the rules defined above, is shown below, where one active pair has been generated. We then show two reductions, which use the previous two rules. The final net, on the right-hand side, is of course the representation of 2, which is the expected answer.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/in_add_res.png' width='550'/>

<p>When defining multiplication, note that the argument <i>y</i> is used twice in the first equation, and it is not used at all in the second one. For that reason, two extra symbols are needed <i>duplicate</i> and <i>erase</i>. </p>

<pre>
sx * y = (x + y) + y               0 * y = 0
</pre>
<img src='../media/refs/in_mul.png' width='450'/>

<p>The idea is that a net representing a natural number should be duplicated when it is connected to the principal port of a <i>duplicate</i>, and it should be erased when it is connected to the principal port of an <i>erase</i>.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/in_dupera.png' width='450'/>

<p>The system of interaction combinators consists of three symbols, called combinators: <i>y</i>(constructor), <i>d</i>(duplicator), and <i>e</i>(eraser). The six interaction rules below are of two kinds: commutation when the two cells carry different symbols (<i>yd</i>, <i>ye</i>, <i>de</i>) and annihilation when they carry the same symbol (<i>yy</i>, <i>dd</i>, <i>ee</i>).</p>

<img src='../media/refs/in_comb.png' width='800' style='max-width:800px'/>

<p>Note that the annihilations for <i>y</i> and <i>d</i> are not the same. Furthermore, if one numbers the auxiliary ports, one realizes that it is <i>yy</i>, not <i>dd</i>, which exchanges the ports:</p>

<img src='../media/refs/in_swp.png' width='450'/>

<q>The fundamental laws of computation are <b>commutation</b> and <b>annihilation</b>.</q>

<h2>Reversible computing is a model of computation in which time is reversible.</h2>

<p>As far as anyone knows, the laws of physics are reversible: that is, you can run them in reverse and recover any earlier state of the universe. This means that from a physical perspective, information can never be destroyed, only shuffled around. A process is said to be physically reversible if it results in no increase in physical entropy; it is isentropic. </p>

<h3>Reversible Logic</h3>

<p>The first condition for any deterministic device to be reversible is that its input and output be uniquely retrievable from each other. This is called logical reversibility. If, in addition to being logically reversible, a device can actually run backwards then it is called physically reversible and the second law of thermodynamics guarantees that it dissipates no heat. </p>

<table border='1' style='float:left; margin-right:30px'>
	<tr><th colspan="2">INPUT</th><th colspan="2">OUTPUT</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For one input bit, there are two possible reversible gates. One of them is NOT. The other is the identity gate, which maps its input to the output unchanged. For two input bits, the only non-trivial gate is the controlled NOT gate, which XORs the first bit to the second bit and leaves the first bit unchanged. </p>

<table border='1' style='float:right; margin-left:30px '>
	<tr><th colspan="3">INPUT</th><th colspan="3">OUTPUT</th></tr>
	<tr><th><i>C</i></th><th><i>I</i><sub>1</sub></th><th><i>I</i><sub>2</sub></th><th><i>C</i></th><th><i>O</i><sub>1</sub></th><th><i>O</i><sub>2</sub></th></tr>

<p>The Fredkin gate, aka CSWAP gate and conservative logic gate, is reversible and universal, which means that any logical or arithmetic operation can be constructed entirely from it.</p>

<p>In reversible computing, all operations must be reversible, and toggling a bit on or off would lose the information about the initial value of that bit. For this reason, there is no way to deterministically put bits in a specific prescribed state unless one is given access to bits whose original state is known in advance. Such bits, whose values are known a priori, are known as ancilla bits. </p>

<p>The common AND gate is not reversible, because the inputs 00, 01 and 10 are all mapped to the output 0. The original motivation for reversible logic gates was that reversible gates dissipate less heat.</p>

<h3>Energy Consumption of Computation</h3>

<p>Landauer's principle holds that with any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the observation apparatus.</p>

<table border='1' style='float:left; margin-right:30px'>

<p>Microprocessors which are reversible at the level of their fundamental logic gates can potentially emit radically less heat than irreversible processors, and someday that may make them more economical than irreversible processors. The <a href='https://esolangs.org/wiki/Pendulum_Instruction_Set_Architecture' target='_blank'>Pendulum microprocessor</a> is a logically reversible computer architecture that resembles a mix of PDP-8 and RISC.</p>

<p>The promise of reversible computing is that the amount of heat loss for reversible architectures would be minimal for significantly large numbers of transistors. Rather than creating entropy (and thus heat) through destructive operations, a reversible architecture conserves the energy by performing other operations that preserve the system state.</p>

<p>An erasure of information in a closed system is always accompanied by an increase in energy consumption.</p>

<h3>Linear Logic</h3>

<p>A <a href='http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html#linear' target='_blank'>linear system</a> excludes combinators that have a duplicative effect, as well as those that a destructive effect. A linear logic computer language avoids the need for garbage collection by explicit construction and destruction of objects. In a reversible machine, garbage collection for recycling storage can always be performed by a reversed sub-computation. The "dangling reference problem" cannot happen in a linear language because the only name occurrence for an object is used to invoke its destructor, and the destructor doesn't return the object.</p>

<p>Most <a href='forth.html'>Forth</a> operators take their operands from the top of the stack and return their values to the top of the stack. The language's absence of variable names is characteristic of <a href='logic.html'>combinators</a>, the programming of Forth operators can therefore be seen as the construction of larger combinators from smaller ones. A Forth which incorporates only stack permutation operations like swap, rotate, and roll must be linear, because it has no copying or killing operators.<a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20171104231932/http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ForthStack.html' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<h2>A virtual machine is a program that acts like a computer.</h2>

<p>It simulates the instructions of a processor along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it.</p>

<p>Virtual machines provide an intermediate language stage for compilation. They bridge the gap between the high level of a programming language and the low level of a real machine. The instructions of an abstract machine are tailored to the particular operations required to implement operations of a specific source language or class of source languages.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/fam.png'/>

<p>A bedrock abstraction level is found in every human system.  No recoverable failure, no matter how catastrophic, will ever demand intelligent intervention below it. When an application crashes, it might leave behind a core dump but never a "logic gate dump" and certainly not a "transistor dump."  Logic gates and transistors lie well below the bedrock abstraction level of any ordinary computer. <a href='http://www.loper-os.org/?p=55' target="_blank">~</a></p>
