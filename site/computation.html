The software we use is coded by programmers who have their own goals, sometimes these goals overlap with ours, over time these will diverge. The tools we depend on grow features we don't use or understand, introducing bugs that will prevent us from reaching our goals.</p><img src='../media/refs/children.png'/>&nbsp;<p>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it, we have the choice of trying another program, and we have the choice of coding the software ourselves. All but the last path mean <a href='stack.html'>endless seeking</a>, evaluating and further deviation from our goals. </p><h3>code it yourself manifesto</h3><ul><li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li><li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li><li>We learn how the tools we depend on need to work.</li><li>We gain a deep understanding of our problem domain.</li><li>We still embrace sharing of ideas and code.</li></ul><p>Software freedom is the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose, to study how the program works, and change it, to redistribute copies and your modified versions so you can help others.</p><img src='../media/refs/tangram.png' width='300'/>&nbsp;<q>The concept that programming is something that you need special education to do is not right. It is something that is promoted by the priesthood.</q><h5>Chuck Moore, Color Forth</h5><p>Asking what is the most suitable programming language for <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a> is a bit like asking what is the most suitable plant for permaculture â€“ the entire question contradicts itself.</p><h2><a href='virtual_machines.html'>virtual machines</a></h2><h4>A collection of experimental computing systems.</h4><p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it. To see examples of this in action, see <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> or <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>.</p><img src='../media/refs/computers.png' width='300'/>&nbsp;<h2><a href='cellular_automata.html'>cellular automata</a></h2><h4>One way to simulate a two-dimensional cellular automaton is with an infinite sheet of graph paper along with a set of rules for the cells to follow.</h4><p>The universe of John Horton Conway's Game Of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours. At each step in time, the following transitions occur: </p><ul>    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li></ul><p>In cellular automata, a <b>methuselah</b> is a small "seed" pattern of initial live cells that take a large number of generations in order to stabilize.</p><iframe width='624' height='380' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NP1N_yv1YAU?rel=0' style='max-width:700px' frameborder='0' allow='autoplay; encrypted-media' allowfullscreen></iframe><h2><a href='fluidics.html'>fluidics</a></h2><h4>Fluidics is the construction of computing systems using fluids.</h4><p>They employed water or air in plastic channels to implement logic gates; the gates were interconnected by standard, flexible plastic tubing. The advantage was their noise immunity, but their size and physical awkwardness was among their many negatives. A typical four-input AND or OR gate alone was about half the size of a deck of cards.</p><img src='../media/refs/fluidics.jpg' width='200'/>&nbsp;<h2><a href='fractals.html'>fractals</a></h2><h4>Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales.</h4><img src='../media/refs/mandelbrot.png' width='500'/>&nbsp;<ul><li><a href='https://archive.org/details/howtobuildaworkingdigitalcomputer_jun67' target='_blank'>Build a Working Digital Computer</a></li><li><a href='https://merveilles.town/web/statuses/105206667496290460' target='_blank'>Thread</a></li><li><a href='https://xkcd.com/505' target='_blank'>A bunch of rocks</a></li><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_computer' target='_blank'>Domino Computer</a></li><li><a href='https://apenwarr.ca/log/20201227' target='_blank'>Systems design</a></li></ul><p><i>incoming(1)</i>: <a href='papier.html'>papier</a> </p></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/webring.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> &copy; 2021 &mdash; <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
