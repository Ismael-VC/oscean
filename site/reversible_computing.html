<p>As far as anyone knows, the laws of physics are reversible: that is, you can run them in reverse and recover the state of the universe at any earlier time. This means that from a physical perspective, information can never be destroyed, only shuffled around. A process is said to be physically reversible if it results in no increase in physical entropy; it is isentropic. </p>

<h3>Reversible Logic</h3>

<p>The common AND gate is not reversible, because the inputs 00, 01 and 10 are all mapped to the output 0. The original motivation for reversible logic gates was that reversible gates dissipate less heat.</p>

<p>For one input bit, there are two possible reversible gates. One of them is NOT. The other is the identity gate, which maps its input to the output unchanged. For two input bits, the only non-trivial gate is the controlled NOT gate, which XORs the first bit to the second bit and leaves the first bit unchanged. </p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th colspan="2">INPUT</th><th colspan="2">OUTPUT</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>

<p>The Fredkin gate, aka CSWAP gate and conservative logic gate, is reversible and universal, which means that any logical or arithmetic operation can be constructed entirely from it.</p>

<p>In reversible computing, all operations must be reversible, and toggling a bit on or off would lose the information about the initial value of that bit. For this reason, there is no way to deterministically put bits in a specific prescribed state unless one is given access to bits whose original state is known in advance. Such bits, whose values are known a priori, are known as ancilla bits. </p>

<h3></h3>

<p>The Pendulum microprocessor and the Pendulum ISA is a logically reversible computer architecture created at MIT. It resembles a mix of PDP-8 and RISC and is the first reversible programmable processor architecture.</p>

<h3>Energy Consumption of Computation</h3>

<p>Landauer's principle holds that with any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the observation apparatus.</p>

<p>Microprocessors which are reversible at the level of their fundamental logic gates can potentially emit radically less heat than irreversible processors, and someday that may make them more economical than irreversible processors. </p>

<p>The promise of reversible computing is that the amount of heat loss for reversible architectures would be minimal for significantly large numbers of transistors. Rather than creating entropy (and thus heat) through destructive operations, a reversible architecture conserves the energy by performing other operations that preserve the system state.</p>

<p>An erasure of information in a closed system is always accompanied by an increase in energy consumption.</p>
