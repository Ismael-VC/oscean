<p>We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of problems in need of <a href='technology.html'>technological</a> or political solutions. We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in the stories we have been telling ourselves.</p>

<p>Collapse won't be addressed by buying a Prius, signing a treaty, or turning off the air-conditioning. The biggest problem we face is a philosophical one: understanding that this civilization is already dead. The sooner we confront this problem, and the sooner we realize thereâ€™s nothing we can do to save ourselves, the sooner we can get down to the hard work of adapting, with mortal humility, to our <a href='collapse.html'>new reality</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>myth of progress</b> tells us that we are destined for greatness, that we began grunting in the primeval swamps, as a humble part of something called <i>nature</i>, which we have now triumphantly subdued.</p>

<p>It came to be understood among the people of our culture that life in <i>the wild</i> was governed by a single, cruel law known as "kill or be killed." In recent decades, ethologists have discovered that this law is a fiction. In fact, a system of laws, universally observed, preserves the tranquility of the wild, protects species and even individuals, and promotes the well-being of the community as a whole. This system of laws has been called, among other things, the peacekeeping law, the law of limited competition, and <a href='vegan.html'>animal ethics</a>.</p>

<h3>regenerative sustainability</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Integrity</b>: Maintaining the wholeness of wider systems, ensuring that structure and relationships remain intact and functioning as they should.</li>
	<li><b>Inclusivity</b>: Interacting with the world in its entirety, engaging and integrating with all dimensions, levels of existence and knowledge.</li>
	<li><b>Harmony</b>: All elements cooperate through relationships that are respectful in order to avoid dissonance.</li>
	<li><b>Respect</b>: All parts of the world have intrinsic worth and all existence is part of the extended self, and therefore all self-respect is extended to mutual respect for the world.</li>
	<li><b>Mutuality</b>: Compassion, treating others the same as yourself.</li>
	<li><b>Positive reciprocity</b>: Reciprocating in a way that is of benefit to and advances the relationship between self and extended self.</li>
	<li><b>Fellowship</b>: An extension of mutuality and positive reciprocity, where the world is co-created by humans in partnership with nature.</li>
	<li><b>Responsibility</b>: Morally accountability for the consequences of our actions in an uncertain and unpredictable world.</li>
	<li><b>Humility</b>: Change is constant, we cannot know the true consequences of our actions.</li>
	<li><b>Non-attachment</b>: In order to adapt to changing circumstances it is important to uphold non-attachment in order to decouple from the futility of trying to hold onto anything in an ever changing world including ideas, dogmas and strategies.</li>
