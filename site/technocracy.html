<p><b>The end of work</b> is the upcoming abstraction and machine automation of mostly all that is currently understood as work. Inside capitalism, the critical moment is specifically where technology meets capital: who gets to own this <i>capital</i>; the "factory without the worker".</p>
<p>The end of work, or <i>the end of jobs</i>, is an immediate <a href='collapse.html'>reality</a>. For most, who are currently subsisting through participation in the wage labour system, this is also end of getting paid and able to "not die". The idea that <i>for every job at the bottom closed by technology, there's one opening at the top</i> is ridiculous.</p>
<q>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country, dividing logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a precise fraction of the state's profit.</q>
<p>The state did not appreciate the journeymen's associations' tendency to <a href='sabotage.html'>strike</a>, nor their ability to move as they pleased when work conditions were unfavorable. The state's response was to take over the management of the construction sites, merging all the divisions of labor together in the supreme distinction between the intellectual and the manual, the theoretical and the practical.</p>
<p>By separating intellectual and physical labor the state took power away from both types of workers. The manual laborers could then only build what others had planned and the planners no longer had the capacity to build anything at all.</p>

	<li><b>Sybil attack</b>: An attacker subverts the reputation system of a P2P network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.</li>
	<li><b>Siren Servers</b>: Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the server concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data center. Alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses.</li>
	<li><b>Paradox of tolerance</b>: States that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.</li>
	<li><b>The Veil Of Ignorance</b>: Behind this veil, you know nothing of yourself and your natural abilities, position in society, sex, race, nationality, or individual tastes. All individuals are simply specified as rational, free, and morally equal beings.</li>
	<li><b>Behavioral sink</b>: A term used to describe the collapse in behavior(stress, alienation, hostility, sexual perversion, parental incompetence, and rabid violence) which resulted from overcrowdedness in an experiment on mice, drawing parallels with societal collapse found in the human Megalopolis.</li>
	<li><b>Dunbar's Number</b>: A suggested cognitive limit of 150, to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.</li>
	<li><b>Kessler syndrome</b>: A theoretical scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.</li>
	<li><b>Consumer farming</b>: The expansionistic practice of looking for new customers to increase sales.</li>
	<li><b>Jevons paradox</b>: Occurs when technological progress or policy increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, reducing the amount necessary for any one use, but the rate of consumption of that resource rises due to increasing demand.</li>
	<li><b>The Iron Triangle</b>: Entrapping interdependence relationships between a house (because you need a place to live), a job (because you need to pay for the house) and a car (because you need to be able to commute to the job).</li>

<p>Today, you're either above the API or below the API. You either tell <a href='moloch.html'>robots</a> what to do, or are told by robots what to do.</p>
<q>They constantly try to escape<br />From the darkness outside and within<br />By dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good.<br />But the man that is will shadow<br />The man that <a href='simulacra.html'>pretends to be</a>.</q>

<p>He drops water onto hordes of irradiated wastrels like a Roman emperor showering plebs with bread and circuses. “Do not become addicted to water,” he cautions them.</p>
