Inside capitalism, the critical moment is specifically where technology meets capital: who gets to own this <i>capital</i>; the "factory without the worker".</p><p>The end of work, or <i>the end of jobs</i>, is an immediate <a href='collapse.html'>reality</a>. For most, who are currently subsisting through participation in the wage labour system, this is also end of getting paid and able to "not die". The idea that <i>for every job at the bottom closed by technology, there's one opening at the top</i> is ridiculous.</p><q>To a neocameralist, a state is a business which owns a country, dividing logical ownership into negotiable shares, each of which yields a precise fraction of the state's profit.</q><p>The state did not appreciate the journeymen's associations' tendency to strike, nor their ability to move as they pleased when work conditions were unfavorable. The state's response was to take over the management of the construction sites, merging all the divisions of labor together in the supreme distinction between the intellectual and the manual, the theoretical and the practical.</p><p>By separating intellectual and physical labor the state took power away from both types of workers. The manual laborers could then only build what others had planned and the planners no longer had the capacity to build anything at all.</p><h3>technocracy</h3><ul><li><b>Sybil attack</b>: An attacker subverts the reputation system of a P2P network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities and uses them to gain a disproportionately large influence.</li><li><b>Siren Servers</b>: Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the server concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data center.
