<h2>Domine is a 2-players domino game.</h2>

<p>The goal is to have the most “living” dominoes at the end of the round. The kit used here, is the <i>Double 9</i> domino set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player draws a hand of seven dominoes and keeps them hidden from their opponent. The two numbers on either side of a domino are the attack and defense points, facing the opponent and the player respectively. The dominoes can be flipped as long as it’s before they are played.</li>
<li>Each turn consists of an attack using a domino and choosing which is the attack side and which is the defense.</li>
<li>Players alternate turns until all dominoes have been played. The player with the most living dominoes wins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attack Rules</h3>
<p>When a player attacks with a domino, the opponent must defend with a value equal to or higher than the attack. If the opponent’s domino defense value is lower than the attack, the domino is killed. If the opponent’s domino defense value is equal to or higher, then they have survived. If the opponent can defend and has an attack number higher than the player’s domino defense value, the opponent can counter to kill the player’s domino. Double dominoes get first strike, regardless if they initiate the attack.</p>

<h2>Gomino is a 2 players dice game.</h2>

<p>The game was originally played by the Iridi people in <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>. Gomino is played with 8 dice, where each face painted into 4 triangles with 2 colors. The paper dice can be made from a <a href='origami.html'>sonobe 6</a>. The iridi dice are painted stones.</p>

<p>There are 6 different sides to a hako die. The fully clear side is called <i>day</i>, the fully painted is called <i>night</i>, the side with two connected triangles is called <i>dusk</i>, the side with two disconnected triangle is called <i>dawn</i>, the remaining sides are called <i>no-moon</i> or <i>full-moon</i>.</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>Players each pick a color, and begin with 4 dice. Each turn, a player rolls a die and try to surround any die in play with 4 triangles of its color. After playing their last die, players pick a die in play which was not the last one played, and which does not create a floating die - And play that die. A floating die is a die with no immediate non-diagonal neighbors. The game when when a player manage to surround a die.</p>

<p>In this example game, the player with the unpainted triangles wins.</p>

<p>The name hako means 24(hexadecimal 18), from 8 x 8-sided dice, in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibi-binary' target='_blank'>Bibi Binary</a>.</p><h2>Donsol is a dungeon-crawler card game.</h2>

<p><b>Donsol</b>, designed by <a href='https://twitter.com/johneternal' target='_blank'>John Eternal</a>, is a card game about exploring a dungeon of 54 playing cards. A rom of the game is available for both <a href='famicom.html'>Famicom</a> and <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>, to learn more about the downloadable version, see <a href='donsol_famicom.html'>this</a>.</p>

<p><b>A standard deck of 54 cards</b>, jokers included, is a dungeon. Shuffle the deck and draw 4 cards, display them before you, this is a room. A room ends when all the cards are folded.</p>

<h3>♥︎ Heart Potions</h3>

<p>A <b>potion</b> gives you health points equal to its value, up to a maximum of 21 health points.</p>

<p>Drinking multiple potions in a row will make you sick and result in no extra healing, only the first potion's value will be gained in HP. Potions are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.</p>

<h3>♦ Diamond Shields</h3>

<p>A <b>shield</b> absorbs the damage difference between the shield value and that of the attacked monster's value.</p>

<p>Shields can only defend against monsters in descending value and if you use a shield on a monster with higher or equal value to the previous, it will break. Broken shields leave you unarmored, and taking full damage. Folding shield card will always replace a previously equipped shield. Shields are equal to their value and face cards (J,Q,K,A) each are equal to 11.</p>

<h3>♣♠ Club/Spades Monsters</h3>

<p>Monster cards are equal to their value, and face cards are as follows J is 11, Q is 13, K is 15, A is 17; Jokers are both equal to 21.</p>

<p>You may <b>escape a room</b>. When escaping, the remaining cards are put back at the end of the deck. A player is allowed to escape a room:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Easy Mode</b>: When all monsters in the room have been dealt with, or when the player has not escaped the previous room. </li>
  <li><b>Normal Mode</b>: Only when the player has not escaped the previous room. </li>
  <li><b>Hard Mode</b>: Only when all monsters in the room have been dealt with. </li>
</ul>

<p>The game was released in collaboration with John Eternal, for mobile in 2016, and re-released for Desktop in 2017 as Hundred Rabbits. While the game was designed on a train, without internet connection during Train Jam 2015, it seemed like Donsol's gameplay accidentally ended up quite similar to Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg's <a href='http://stfj.net/index2.php?project=art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf'>Scoundrel</a>, designed in 2011.</p><ul>
