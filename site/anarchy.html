<p>Anarchism is a social movement that seeks liberation from oppressive systems of control including but not limited to the state, capitalism, racism, sexism, ableism, <a href='vegan.html'>speciesism</a>, and religion. </p>
<p>Anarchists wish to create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary cooperation. Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.</p>
<p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.</p>
<p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price â€” except at the price of liberty.</p>
<p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.</p>

<p>Luddism was a working-class movement opposed to the political consequences of industrial capitalism. The Luddites wanted <a href='technology.html'>technology</a> to be deployed in ways that made work more humane and gave workers more <a href='technocracy.html'>autonomy</a>. The bosses, on the other hand, wanted to drive down costs and <a href='commodity.html'>increase productivity</a>.</p>

<p>A neo-Luddite movement would understand no technology is sacred in itself, but is only worthwhile insofar as it benefits society. It would confront the harms done by digital capitalism and seek to address them by giving people more power over the technological systems that structure their lives.</p>

<h2>The marvelous pursuit is an attempt to find paths out of alienation, by refusing to conceive of human action as divisible into the physical and the mental.</h2>

<p>The marvelous pursuit is born from the desire to create playful complexity in a desert of simplistic convenience. A hobby is a form of consumption, the marvelous pursuit on the other hand, is a rejection of <a href='commodity.html'>commodified convenience</a>, it can't be bought because it has no price. A marvelous pursuit refuses socially ascribed use. People learn such socially useless things as the names of fern and the grammar of dead languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to them on TV.</p>

<p>Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces. The marvelous pursuit often creates complexity but a complexity which is opposed to that of the technician. The <i>master</i> of a marvelous pursuit can never be an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society (and therefore to capital).</p>

<p>The value in marvelous pursuits lies in their self-creation which evades both use-value and exchange value.</p>

<p>Hobbies are forms of <a href='simulacra.html'>alienated leisure</a>, compartmentalized parts of one's life, past-times whose purpose is to fill our time with countable accomplishments and enjoyments.</p>

<p>Rustic Computing refers to the construction of calculation machines using pre-industrial or even pre-historic technology. It reveals a history of computing as the pastime of dilettantes, amateur scientists and tabulators who construct machines to manipulate abstract symbols with no practical application.  As these machines are generally less efficient than conventional pencil and paper computation, they allude to a more epicurean practice of computing for pleasure rather than production.</p>
