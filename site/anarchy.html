Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.</p><p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.</p><p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price — except at the price of liberty.</p><p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.</p><img src='../media/refs/opa.png'/>&nbsp;<q>The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.</q><h5>Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed</h5><h3>green anarchism</h3><ul><li><b>Anarchy</b>: A word that comes from the Greek, and signifying "without government", the state of a people without any constituted authority.</li><li><b>Health</b>: A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</li><li><b>Dark Greens</b>: The ones who believe that environmental problems are an inherent part of industrialized civilization, and seek radical political change.</li><li><b>Light Greens</b>: The ones who see protecting the environment first and foremost as a personal responsibility, focusing on environmentalism as a lifestyle choice.</li><li><b>Veganism</b>: A philosophy and way of living which seeks to prevent all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, other animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.</li><li><b>Ecofeminism</b>: Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of gender to theorize on the relationship between humans and the natural world.</li></ul><img src='../media/refs/tactics.jpg'/>&nbsp;<h2><a href='sabotage.html'>sabotage</a></h2><h4>Monkey wrenches are still manufactured and are used for some heavy tasks.</h4><p>Luddism was a working-class movement opposed to the political consequences of industrial capitalism. The Luddites wanted <a href='technology.html'>technology</a> to be deployed in ways that made work more humane and gave workers more <a href='technocracy.html'>autonomy</a>. The bosses, on the other hand, wanted to drive down costs and <a href='commodity.html'>increase productivity</a>.</p><img src='../media/refs/wrench.jpg' width='200'/>&nbsp;<p>A neo-Luddite movement would understand no technology is sacred in itself, but is only worthwhile insofar as it benefits society. It would confront the harms done by digital capitalism and seek to address them by giving people more power over the technological systems that structure their lives.</p><h2><a href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>marvelous pursuit</a></h2><h4>The marvelous pursuit is an attempt to find paths out of alienation, by refusing to conceive of human action as divisible into the physical and the mental.</h4><p>The marvelous pursuit is born from the desire to create playful complexity in a desert of simplistic convenience. A hobby is a form of consumption, the marvelous pursuit on the other hand, is a rejection of <a href='commodity.html'>commodified convenience</a>, it can't be bought because it has no price. A marvelous pursuit refuses socially ascribed use. People learn such socially useless things as the names of fern and the grammar of dead languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to them on TV.</p><p>Marvelous pursuits are a means to resist alienation from one's environment because they are a temporary means to make that environment one's own, by ascribing one's own, often bizarre, value for things and spaces. The marvelous pursuit often creates complexity but a complexity which is opposed to that of the technician. The <i>master</i> of a marvelous pursuit can never be an engineer because the marvelous is by nature useless to society (and therefore to capital).</p><p>The value in marvelous pursuits lies in their self-creation which evades both use-value and exchange value.</p><p>Hobbies are forms of alienated leisure, compartmentalized parts of one’s life, past-times whose purpose is to fill our time with countable accomplishments and enjoyments.</p><hr /><p>Rustic Computing refers to the construction of calculation machines using pre-industrial or even pre-historic technology.  It reveals a history of computing as the pastime of dilettantes, amateur scientists and gentleman tabulators who construct machines to manipulate abstract symbols with no practical application.  As these machines are generally less efficient than conventional pencil and paper computation, they allude to a more epicurean practice of computing for pleasure rather than production.</p><ul><li><a href='http://www.tangledwilderness.org/life-without-law/' target='_blank'>Life Without Law</a></li><li><a href='https://iaf-fai.org' target='_blank'>Indigenous Anarchist Federation</a></li><li><a href='https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm' target='_blank'>Tyranny of structurelessness</a></li></ul><p><i>incoming(1)</i>: <a href='ethics.html'>ethics</a> </p></main><footer><a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0'><img src='../media/icon/cc.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/'><img src='../media/icon/rotonde.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/merveilles.svg' width='30'/></a><a href='https://github.com/neauoire'><img src='../media/icon/github.png' alt='github' width='30'/></a><span><a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine Lu Linvega</a> &copy; 2021 &mdash; <a href='about.html'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a></span></footer></body></html>
