Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.</p><p>Anarchists advocate a self-managed, classless, stateless society without borders, bosses, or rulers where everyone takes collective responsibility for the health and prosperity of themselves and the environment.</p><p>To be free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same. Anarchists fight for a society which respects individuals and their freedom, and believe in peace at any price â€” except at the price of liberty.</p><p>Harmony in such a society is obtained, not by submission to law, or by obedience to any authority, but by free agreements concluded between the various groups, territorial and professional, freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption, as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being.</p><img src='../media/refs/opa.png'/>&nbsp;<q>The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.</q><h5>Ursula K.
