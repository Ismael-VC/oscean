<p>&mdash; <i>Woe, make me your student</i></p>
<h2>2022</h2>

<p><code>16I</code> ; Managed to aquire a few <a href='slide_rule.html'>slide rules</a> and figure out how to work them. I've spent the better part of the past few days to plot, on paper, circles and triangles from the results. At the same time, I've written a little line-plotting virtual machine to help me with some vector art experiments I had in mind.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Created a line-plotting system called <a href="turquoise.html" target="_blank">Turquoise</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16H</code> ; I was thinking back on <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>'s development this week, especially about the period when the last few operators were being finalized. A handful of livecoders and myself were already using it as the remaining rough edges were still being figured out. I recall people in the chatroom who would raise hell each time operators were moved around. Looking back, I'm glad that I didn't freeze the specs then, or Orca would not have its current operators and symmetries, I had to remind myself of that.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn5" target="_blank">HTML5 implementation</a> of UxnVM.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/generic/permacomputing.png' />

<p><code>16G</code> ; Inspired from the <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2015004_cuneiform.pdf" target="_blank">Cuneiform Tablets</a> paper, I considered realizing the paper's point of implementing <a href='https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/989' target="_blank">Smalltalk72</a> on a UVM, I spent a few days experimenting with the ST72 environment &mdash; Only to realize that, like the <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~rabbits/b23e80eaf675c1b704bc704577e503cfd0d8f474" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a>, it is poorly thought out and fundamentally irreconcilable with <i>smol computing</i>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a plain <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11" target="_blank">X11 implementation</a> of Varvara.</li>
	<li>Began creating a REPL, called <a href='bicycle.html'>Varvara's Bicycle</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16F</code> ; We gave our talk at <a href='https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/libreplanet-living-liberation-day-two-retrospective-and-motivation-for-freedom' target="_blank">LibrePlanet 2022</a>, and it went very well. During the Q&A, we talked about living without a fridge, from food preservation to <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sprouting.html' target="_blank">sprouting</a>, and we were delighted to see so many people interested in that stuff. I guess the intersection of computers and gardens is slightly larger than I thought. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Played a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1eC8czDAkk' target="_blank">little set</a> for Algorave's 10th anniversary.</li>
	<li>Revamped Orca, Nasu, and Left to support Varvara's new Screen/Auto port.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16E</code> ; Took a deep dive into the various experiments in digital preservation(PADI, CAMiLEON, Domesday, etc..), didn't really find anything worthy of note, but it did inspire me to rewrite some of the content on <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a>. I've also spent the past couple of days improving <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, and adding support for <a href="tga_format.html">tga</a> images.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/turing.gif' width="300" />

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a little single-file Uxntal assembler called <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16D</code> ; Rekka is putting the finishing touches to the <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a> novel, and asked me to design a game that the people of Iridi could be playing. I thought a dice game combining the capture mechanism of Go and the randomness of the Domino draw might be a good fit, learn to play <a href='hako.html'>Hako</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBTzswUmzY' target='_blank'>J & Y wiring</a>, in the Uxn port of Orca.</li>
	<li>Wrote a version of <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/minesweeper' target='_blank'>minesweeper</a> for Varvara.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16C</code> ; Our upcoming keynote for <a href='https://www.fsf.org/news/artist-collective-hundred-rabbits-to-keynote-libreplanet-living-liberation' target='_blank'>Libre Planet 2022</a> has been announced, we've built a little <a href='adelie.html'>slideshow program</a> for the presentation. I've revamped the <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> documentation and added a <a href='orca_reference.html'>reference page</a>, as well as fixing a few bugs in the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy' target='_blank'>Uxntal implementation</a>. Toying with wireworld sucked much of my time, again.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added incoming links to Oscean.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16B</code> ; Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a Serbian and Polish translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/wireworld' target="_blank">wireworld</a>. Ah! Also, <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> turned one year old.</p>

<img src="../media/generic/uxn.cake.png" width="250">

<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the Uxn project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>second one</a> is about a personal computer and the last one will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>

<h2>2021</h2>

<p>The pandemic restrictions forced us to stay at one place, if only for a moment. To stop running and possibly build something, to spend more time with the same people and to become familiar with our surroundings. Every year is meant to be my <a href='https://www.raptitude.com/2018/12/why-the-depth-year-was-my-best-year/' target='_blank'>depth year</a>, every January, I tell myself that this time, finally, I will look deeper into things. I typically don't follow through, and this year might not have been as deep a year as I had hoped, but I can say that my understanding of a few specific things have deepened.</p>

<p>By the year's end, I, along with a handful of amazing people, had brought a little <a href='uxntal.html'>programming language</a> into the world, it cannot do much at all, but building this project brought me closer to understanding the deeper questions I had about programming, especially how human-language maps to symbols that computers can understand.</p>

<p>Between the air that's hard to breath due to forest fires, and the water rationing that stops us from filling up our tanks, the tumbling down of everything has, to my surprise, not paralyzed me as much as I expected. It has been a constant creative force that pushed me through the year to learn about food preservation, water purification, insulation, heating, and various endeavors that I had previously overlooked, and that might come in handy would things keep on deteriorating.</p>

<img src='../media/diary/399.jpg'/>

<p>Among the more trivial things that brought me joy this year, I've successfully grown a large lion's mane mushroom aboard the boat, worked on a wonderful tribute of the <a href='catclock.html'>catclock</a> with Rekka, did plenty of <a href='origami.html'>origami</a> with our friend's kids and played accordion for the first time.</p>

<p>For the year of 2021, Edward Abbey's The Monkey Wrench Gang, was my favourite <a href='reading.html'>book</a>. The Lobster was my favourite <a href='watching.html'>movie</a>. Tamaryn's Dreaming The Dark was my favourite <a href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

<img src='../media/refs/xneko.png'/>

<p><code>15Z</code> ; Began the second week of December by learning about the <a href='tga_format.html'>tga format</a> and implementing a viewer for Varvara. Time to revisit the notes I've collected on <a href='paper_computing.html'>paper computing</a> and reflect on this massive year that is now closing.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a <a href='chip8.html'>CHIP-8</a> emulator for Varvara.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>15Y</code> ; Spent the first few days of December solving the <a href='https://adventofcode.com/' target='_blank'>Advent Of Code</a> puzzles in Uxntal, got bored, and started thinking about displaying little pictures inside of <a href='left.html'>Left</a>, as well as rewriting <a href='marabu.html'>Marabu</a>. I've also spent time experimenting with the <a href='subleq.html'>Subleq</a> virtual machine.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented inline graphics to <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>/<a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</li>
	<li>Released the <a href='turye.html'>Turye</a> font-editor.</li>
	<li>Released a Cat clock.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>15X</code> ; Was away from <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> to visit family, spent evenings catching up or <a href='watching.html'>watching</a> movies. Received a replacement keyboard for <a href='ayatori.html'>Ayatori</a>, it's good to be back on the Thinkpad.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rewrote the Uxn assembler to use a single pass.</li>
	<li>Released <a href='busy_doing_nothing.html'>Busy Doing Nothing</a> in paperback.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>15W</code> ; Wrote a little <a href='brainfuck.html'>brainfuck</a> interpreter in Uxntal while traveling. My toughts have been drifting back to <a href='primes.html'>primes</a> and <a href='fractions.html'>fractions</a> for computing, I've been considering a twist to <a href='fractran.html'>fractran</a> where fractions with a zero as nominator or denominator might be used for as jump operations, but I have yet to implement this.</p>

<img src='../media/refs/jeremy.png'/>

<p><code>15V</code> ; Decided to stop doing daily drawings and port <a href='donsol.html'>Donsol</a> instead. I had it all planned out in my head before starting, I went ahead and completed the port within just a few days. The work was done on a Pinebook Pro, revealing a few issues with <a href='left.html'>Left</a>, so I spent some time optimizing the text-editor so it would run faster.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Released <a href='donsol.html'>Donsol</a>, for Varvara.</li>
	<li>Added a <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>reference manual</a> for the Uxntal opcodes.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>15U</code> ; Spending the month of October between <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/statuses/107033448028097574' target='_blank'>daily drawings</a>, and various <a href='https://100r.co/site/growing_food.html' target='_blank'>food preservation projects</a>. As I work on a picture, I'll occasionally stop and improve <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a> is some way or another. The near totality of my computer activities(drawing, composing and programming) are now done from within the <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> virtual machine. <i>I couldn't be happier</i>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added guides for the line and rect tool, in <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>.</li>
	<li>Added interface responsiveness, in <a href='dexe.html'>Dexe</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>15T</code> ; Rewrote <a href='dexe.html'>Dexe</a> to be compatible to the latest changes to Varvara. I'm unsure what to do about Oscean's twtxt and RSS feeds, generating them in Uxntal will be hard, especially the date conversion. Maybe I could build the now page's body from the twtxt feed, but if I did, I would loose the <a href='varvara.html'>Arvelie</a> timestamps and links. Picked up <a href='moogle.html'>Moogle</a> again, cleaned up the codebase.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added 1-bit output format, in <a href='moogle.html'>Moogle</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>15S</code> ; The grey weather gives us only a few hours of solar power each day, so we alternate between cleaning and doing other things, such as <a href='origami.html'>origami</a>. I've been optimizing <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, trying to make it run faster, following in the line of optimizations of <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Added d-pad controls, in <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>15R</code> ; Currently rewriting <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> in Uxntal, as an experiment to see how far I can push Uxn, and what a wiki-from-first-principles might look like. A few features have yet to be ported, but the main components are done. We're slowly sailing North toward Vancouver to see friends, we left Saturna for Ladysmith and Silva Bay, Pino has engine problems, again. </p>

<p><code>15Q</code> ; Completed <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, anchored near <a href='canada.html'>Saturna</a>. It's nice to be sailing and working off-grid again. I've started porting <a href='paradise.html'>paradise</a> in Uxntal, it would be nice to port <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> at some point too. I'm considering stopping to keep a daily diary now, it has been 16 years, I think I've tried everything I wanted to try.</p>
