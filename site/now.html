	<h2>2023-04-22 Structured Editing</h2>
	<p>These past few months, I've explored playful things with programming that might not directly serve a purpose, or at least, one wouldn't come across them without seeking them out specifically, and I've collected some of those seemingly useless, ideas into a talk and submitted it to the <a href='https://www.thestrangeloop.com' target='_blank'>Strange Loop</a> conference happening in September.</p>
	<p>Also, while I consider <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a> to be a kind of disassembler, I wanted to see if I could build something that would let me go from a source file to an assembled rom, and back again. I figured that being able to recover a project from a rom and its symbols file has important potential in terms of data preservation. To make this possible, I modified the <a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> to include comments, and was able to complete the back and forth I wanted.</p>
	<p>In turn, this opened up the door to something called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor'>structured editing</a>, in which you might modify the textual representation of a program, but in truth, you are modifying the underlying symbols and bytecode.</p>

	<h2>2023-04-05 Interaction Nets & Oquonie</h2>
	<p>The past two weeks have flown by, between finishing <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> and preparing <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> for the summer, each day I fall into bed completely exhausted. But the game is nearly finished now, there are fewer and fewer bugs, and most of my time is spent doing optimization.</p>
	<p>I've been diving into <a href='interaction_nets.html'>Interaction Nets</a> again, and I've fallen head over heels with Sato's <a href='https://github.com/inpla/inpla' target='_blank'>Inpla</a> language, the code is a nightmare but I feel that with a bit of work, and a better division between the interpreter and virtual machine, this could turn out to be something very fun.</p>
	<p>After watching Alan Kay's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY' target='_blank'>OOPSLA 1997</a> talk, I went and read <a href='reading.html'>Smalltalk-80: Bits of History, Words of Advice</a> and I've been fascinated with it. It goes in details about their approach to the implementations of the <a href='smalltalk.html'>Smalltalk</a> VM, and the challenges to getting the ST-80 image to boot on all these different platforms.</p>

	<h2>2023-03-13 Residency at Biosonic</h2>
	<p>Spent the week at the <a href='https://lenaresidency.com' target='_blank'>LEÃ‘A residency</a> collaborating with audio-visual artists. They call it a <i>retreat</i>, but really, I returned from Galiano more exhausted than when I left. It was well worth it tho, as I rarely allow myself to play music for more than an hour or two at a time.</p>
	<p>I've had a bit of time to kill between rehearsals, and whenever I had a few minutes to myself, I'd pour over the <a href='../docs/memo528_cadr.html' target='_blank'>Lisp Machine memos</a>. It occurred to me that the <i>byol</i>-type books really ought to teach about targetting Lisp architectures(or at the very least, something in the vein of <a href='secd.html'>SECD</a> abstract machines), instead of implementing <a href='lisp.html'>Lisp</a> on top of imperative languages, which does a disservice to the entire exercise.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Preparing slides for our talk at <a href='https://activepassive.ca/' target='_blank'>Biosonic</a>.</li>
		<li>Implemented the <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/110017135586137496' target='_blank'>Hilbert Curve</a> fractal.</li>
		<li>Returned <a href='gly_format.html'>image</a> support to <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</li>
		<li>Added the <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a> splash to <a href='donsol.html'>Donsol</a>.</li>

	<h2>2023-03-03 Preparing for Biosonic</h2>
	<p>I've been progressing on <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a>, implementing sounds and making sure that it runs as smoothly as possible on as many different platforms as I can. This meant revisiting a lot of the implementation details. The month has flown by, but it has been a lot of fun learning about optimization.</p>
	<p>I will be staying on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galiano_Island' target='_blank'>Galiano</a> for a week during the Biosonic residency, it has been a while since I've last slept on firm ground.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Preparing slides for our talk at <a href='https://activepassive.ca/' target='_blank'>Biosonic</a>.</li>
		<li>Wrote a faster <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/main/item/src/uxn.c' target='_blank'>Uxn core</a>.</li>

	<h2>2023-02-24 Oquonie is nearly ready</h2>
	<p>The weather has been absolute garbage and so has been a great help in advancing the <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> port. Not only is the project pushing <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> further than it previously ventured, but it is equally pushing the tools used in its creation. The building of the game has had me do some significant improvements to <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnlin' target='_blank'>Uxnlin</a>, and <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It looks like Oquonie will make its way to the <a href='playdate.html'>Playdate</a>.</li>
		<li>Played a set at the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5mBG1hlDQU' target='_blank'>Lovebyte Party</a>.</li>
		<li>Added a REPL mode to <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>.</li>

	<h2>2023-02-07 Oquonie is happening!</h2>
	<p>After putting together a demo of what a <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> implementation of <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> could look like, Rekka and I decided to officially port it. It's a lot of fun to revisit this little universe. I hope that we can bring the essence of the original into the redux version.</p>

		<li>Spared some time to fix a handful of issues in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy/' target='_blank'>Orca</a>.</li>

	<h2>2023-01-20 Function Stacks</h2>
	<p>I've been reading about <a href='reversible_computing.html'>reversible computing</a> and put together a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/psi-forth' target='_blank'>playground</a> that allows me to experiment with the ideas of <a href='../docs/psi_lisp.html'>psi-lisp</a>. This whole business of time reversible logic feels like visiting <a href='the_sartre_mechanism.html'>an old friend</a>.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, I've also tried to bring <a href='potato.html'>potato</a> to a usable state, which means that for it to entirely replace the current launcher, it should be able to assemble and run the assembled rom, a state to which I am inching closer.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Finally found a use for the 3 unused <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>uxn opcodes</a>.</li>
		<li>Rewrote the <a href='../etc/uxnrepl/index.html'>javascript REPL</a> implementation.</li>
		<li>Could I possibly port <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a>, to Uxntal?</li>

	<h2>2023-01-08 Pino Rewiring</h2>
	<p>Since the turn of the year, we have spent every waking hour <a href='http://100r.co/site/electrical_refit.html' target='_blank'>rewiring Pino</a>, it has been a more challenging project than we had hoped but we will sleep soundly knowing that each connection has been well made.</p>
	<p>I've read Koopman's <a href='https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers' target='_blank'>Stack Machines: The New Wave</a> and it inspired me to experiment with other virtual machine designs, namely that of the NOVIX NC4016. But after two weeks of experiments, I returned to writing Uxntal, partly because I do not feel limited in the realization of my ideas with my current stack, and partly because these sort of systems make for extremely obfuscated assembly languages. That being said, I can't seem to shake the craving to experiment with the <a href='../docs/dssp.txt'>Setun-70</a>..</p>
