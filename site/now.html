	<h2>2023-03-13 Residency at Biosonic</h2>
	<p>Spent the week at the <a href='https://lenaresidency.com' target='_blank'>LEÃ‘A residency</a> collaborating with audio-visual artists. They call it a <i>retreat</i>, but really, I returned from Galiano more exhausted than when I left. It was well worth it, as I rarely allow myself to play music for more than an hour or two at a time.</p>
	<p>I've had a bit of time to kill between rehearsals, and whenever I had a few minutes to myself, I'd pour over the <a href='../docs/memo528_cadr.html' target='_blank'>Lisp Machine memos</a>. It occurred to me that the <i>byol</i>-type books really ought to teach about targetting Lisp architectures(or at the very least, something in the vein of <a href='secd.html'>SECD</a> virutal machines), instead of implementing <a href='lisp.html'>Lisp</a> on top of imperative languages, which does a disservice to the entire exercise.</p>

	<p>I've been working on completing <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a>, implementing sounds, writing the music and making sure that it runs as smoothly as possible on as many different platforms as I can. This meant revisiting a lot of the implementation details. The month has flown by, but it has been a lot of fun learning about optimization.</p>
	<p>I will be staying on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galiano_Island' target='_blank'>Galiano</a> for a week during the Biosonic residency, it has been a while since I've last slept on firm ground.</p>

	<p>The weather has been absolute garbage and so has been a great help in advancing the <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> port. Not only is the project pushing <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> further than it previously ventured, but it is equally pushing the tools used in its creation. The building of the game has had me do some significant improvements to <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnlin' target='_blank'>Uxnlin</a>, and <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</p>

This whole business of time reversible logic feels like visiting <a href='the_sartre_mechanism.html'>an old friend</a>.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, I've also tried to bring <a href='potato.html'>potato</a> to a usable state, which means that for it to entirely replace the current launcher, it should be able to assemble and run the assembled rom, a state to which I am inching closer.</p>
	<ul>

	<p>Since the turn of the year, we have spent every waking hour <a href='http://100r.co/site/electrical_refit.html' target='_blank'>rewiring Pino</a>, it has been a more challenging project than we had hoped but we will sleep soundly knowing that each connection has been well made.</p>
	<p>I've read Koopman's <a href='https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers' target='_blank'>Stack Machines: The New Wave</a> and it inspired me to experiment with other virtual machine designs, namely that of the NOVIX NC4016. But after two weeks of experiments, I returned to writing Uxntal, partly because I do not feel limited in the realization of my ideas with my current stack, and partly because these sort of systems make for extremely obfuscated assembly languages. That being said, I can't seem to shake the craving to experiment with the <a href='../docs/dssp.txt'>Setun-70</a>..</p>

<h2>2022</h2>

<p>We sailed to Desolation Sound in late spring spring, spent the summer up there, and didn't return until the fall. We left with stores bursting with <a href='http://grimgrains.com/site/lactofermentation.html' target='_blank'>preserved foods</a>, allowing us to stay away for months without the need to resupply.</p>

<p>I hadn't entirely made up my mind about Uxn when the year started, I thought it might not be something that I would want to keep on using, but the year came and went without ever finding myself wanting to program in other languages.</p>

<img src='../media/diary/785.jpg'/>

<p>For the year of 2022, Richard Adams' Watership Down, was my favourite <a href='reading.html'>book</a>. Only Yesterday was my favourite <a href='watching.html'>movie</a>. SadSvit's Cassette was my favourite <a href='listening.html'>album</a>. </p>

	<h2>2022-12-25 Reversible Computing</h2>
	<p>This week, I was introduced to <a href='reversible_computing.html'>reversible computing</a> and linear logic, which not only do not generate garbage, but also preserves state by making any loss of entropy explicit and an integral part of the program's architecture. To say that this new knowledge shook my understanding of programming would be an understatement.</p>

	<h2>2022-12-12 Beetbug</h2>
	<p>Continuing my recent experiments with the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/blinkengenie' target='_blank'>self-hosted emulator</a>, I decided to repurpose it and turn it into an entirely virtualized step-debugger. It is called <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>, after <a href='https://github.com/randrew/uxn32' target='_blank'>Uxn32</a>'s debugger. To improve error reporting across the ecosystem, I've also written a simple <a href='symbols.html'>symbols file</a> specs that will allow the various emulators and debuggers to add labels to addresses when throwing errors and warnings.</p>
	<p>As I was learning to use the Soroban to do elementary level multiplications, I stumbled on this <a href='https://ethw.org/Ancient_Computers' target='_blank'>fantastic article</a> on the use of the Salamis Tablet, which has been fascinating me and occupying my mind at night. There, now it can torment you too.</p>

	<h2>2022-11-27 Soroban</h2>
	<p>I had this idea of implementing the Uxn virtual machine <i>in itself</i>, to virtualize the memory and runtime entirely in a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/blinkengenie' target='_blank'>sandboxed emulator</a> rom. That would allow something like a debugger to be built that doesn't preclude any special <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> support.</p>
	<p>I also tried writing a <a href='http://turboforth.net/tutorials/blocks.html' target='_blank'>block editor</a> for Uxntal, but failed, I couldn't make up my mind on how to visualize each cell, and in the end, I've decided to drop the idea and went back to reading Takashi Kojima's <i>Advanced Abacus</i> book and toying with my <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/soroban' target='_blank'>virtual soroban</a> while the snow fell on the boat.</p>

I've spent the better part of the week plotting shapes on paper with the help of the slide rule, while also experimenting with a <a href="turquoise.html">line-plotting engine</a>, inspired from <i>Turtle Graphics</i>, for creating procedural graphics.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Made a little <a href='nebu.html'>spreadsheet program</a> that fits neatly in a 6kb rom.</li>
		<li>Wrote a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn5" target="_blank">HTML5 implementation</a> of UxnVM.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2022-04-30 Uxn Specs</h2>
	<p>I felt frustrated by the development of Uxn this week. It reminded me of the difficult period in Orca's development when it was beginning to be actively used, meanwhile the last few operators were being finalized. Folks would raise hell each time operators were moved around and it made finalizing the spec extremely painful.</p>

	<h2>2022-04-14 Bedrock Failure</h2>
	<p>Inspired from the <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2015004_cuneiform.pdf" target="_blank">Cuneiform Tablets</a> paper, I considered realizing the paper's point of implementing <a href='https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/989' target="_blank">Smalltalk72</a> on a UVM, I spent a few days experimenting with the ST72 environment &mdash; Only to realize that, like the <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~rabbits/b23e80eaf675c1b704bc704577e503cfd0d8f474" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a>, it is poorly thought out and fundamentally irreconcilable with my vision of small computing.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wrote a plain <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11" target="_blank">X11 implementation</a> of Varvara.</li>
		<li>Created an Uxntal REPL, called <a href='bicycle.html'>Varvara's Bicycle</a>.</li>

	<h2>2022-03-30 FSF</h2>
	<p>We gave our talk at <a href='https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/libreplanet-living-liberation-day-two-retrospective-and-motivation-for-freedom' target="_blank">LibrePlanet 2022</a>, and it went very well. During the Q&A, we talked about living without a fridge, from food preservation to <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sprouting.html' target="_blank">sprouting</a>, and we were delighted to see so many people interested in that stuff. I guess the intersection of computers and gardens is slightly larger than I thought. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Played a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1eC8czDAkk' target="_blank">little set</a> for Algorave's 10th anniversary.</li>
		<li>Revamped Orca, Nasu, and Left to support Varvara's new Screen/Auto port.</li>

	<h2>2022-03-14 Digital Preservation</h2>
	<p>Took a deep dive into the various experiments in digital preservation(PADI, CAMiLEON, Domesday, etc..), didn't really find anything worthy of note, but it did inspire me to rewrite some of the content on <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a>. I've also spent the past couple of days improving <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, and adding support for <a href="tga_format.html">tga</a> images.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wrote a little single-file Uxntal assembler called <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>

	<h2>2022-02-30 A Dice Game</h2>
	<p>Rekka is putting the finishing touches to <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>, and asked me to design a game that the people of Iridi could be playing. I thought a dice game combining the capture mechanism of Go and the randomness of the Domino draw might be a good fit, learn to play <a href='hako.html'>Hako</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implemented <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBTzswUmzY' target='_blank'>J & Y wiring</a>, in the Uxn port of Orca.</li>
		<li>Wrote a version of <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/minesweeper' target='_blank'>minesweeper</a> for Varvara.</li>

	<h2>2022-02-14</h2>
	<p>Our upcoming keynote for <a href='https://www.fsf.org/news/artist-collective-hundred-rabbits-to-keynote-libreplanet-living-liberation' target='_blank'>Libre Planet 2022</a> has been announced, we've built a little <a href='adelie.html'>slideshow program</a> for the presentation. I've revamped the <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> documentation and added a <a href='orca_reference.html'>reference page</a>, as well as fixing a few bugs in the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy' target='_blank'>Uxntal implementation</a>. Toying with wireworld sucked much of my time, again.</p>
	<p>Finally, brought back incoming links at the bottom of wiki pages. They had been gone since the migration from C, to Uxntal.</p>

	<p>Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a Serbian and Polish translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/wireworld' target="_blank">wireworld</a>. Ah! Also, <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> turned one year old.</p>

	<h2>2022-01-14 Devlog Start</h2>
	<p>To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the Uxn project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>second one</a> is about a personal computer and the <a href='potato_devlog.html'>last one</a> will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>
