<p>The basic file structure is broken into the following four sections:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>The File Header (14 bytes)</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Confirms that the file is (at least probably) a BMP file.</li>
			<li>Tells exactly how large the file is.</li>
			<li>Tells where the actual image data is located within the file.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>The Image Header (40 bytes in the versions of interest)</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Tells how large the image is (rows and columns).</li>
			<li>Tells what format option is used (bits per pixel).</li>
			<li>Tells which type of compression, if any, is used.</li>
			<li>Provides other details, all of which 
			are seldom used.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>The Color Table (length varies and is not always present)</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Provides the color palette for bit depths of 8 or less.</li>
			<li>Provides the (optional) bit masks for bit depths of 16 and 32.</li>
			<li>Not used for 24-bit images.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>The Pixel Data</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Pixel by pixel color information</li>
			<li>Row-by-row, bottom to top.</li>
			<li>Rows start on double word (4-byte) boundaries and are null padded if necessary.</li>
			<li>Each row is column-by-column, left to right.</li>
			<li>In 24-bit images, color order is Red, Green, Blue.</li>
			<li>In images less than 8-bits, the higher order bits are the left-most pixels.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these four sections is discussed in detail below.</p>

<p>Endianness - Since this is a Microsoft format 
specification originally targeted for Intel processors, most multibyte 
values are stored in Little Endian format. This means that the bytes within 
the value are stored starting with the least significant byte first and the 
most significant byte last. Since this is how multibyte values are 
represented internally on an Intel processor, you will not need to worry 
about this convention as long as you transfer multibyte values directly 
between the file and memory. The only exception to this rule is for 16-bit 
pixel data in the WinNT version, which is stored in Big Endian. Note that 
ASCII character strings are not multibyte values -- they are strings of 
single-byte characters -- and, hence, the very concept of Endianness does 
not apply to them.</p>

<h1>The File Header</h1>

<p>The File Header has exactly fourteen bytes separated into five 
fields.</p>

<table border='1'>

  <td width="17%"><strong>Field Name</strong></td>

</table>
<h3>bfType</h3>

<p>The first 
two bytes must be the ASCII codes for the characters 'B' and 'M'. The software 
should check these values to confirm that the file it is reading is most 
probably a Windows BMP file. There are actually other options for these two 
characters, but they all refer to formats developed for the OS/2 operating 
system, which is largely extinct. </p>

<h3>bfSize</h3>

<p>The second field is a four-byte integer that 
contains the size of the file in bytes. In theory, this means that a BMP file 
could be as large as 4GB (4,294,967,296 bytes), however it is not safe to 
assume that all editors will treat this as an unsigned value and therefore a 
more reasonable limit is 2GB (2,147,483,648 bytes). This can accommodate a 
24-bit image that contains over 715 million pixels (e.g., a picture larger 
than 32,000 by 23,000 pixels). It is probably worth noting that the BMP file 
specification actually supports storing multiple images in a single file; 
however, this is almost never done and very few editors support this option.</p>

<h3>bfReserved1</h3>

<h3>bfReserved2</h3>

<p>The third and fourth fields are each 
two bytes long and are reserved for future extensions to the format 
definition. While certainly not impossible, it is unlikely at this point that 
either will ever be used. The present definition requires that both of these fields be zero. 
A well-written reader should behave reasonably if non-zero values are 
encountered, but what is "reasonable"? Should the reader ignore the values 
regardless of what they are, or should it refuse to proceed any further on 
the assumption that the file conforms to a later version of the format 
specification and that it has no basis for assuming that it can properly 
interpret the contents? Good arguments can be made for either approach. 
Assuming that the decision is made to go ahead and read the file while 
ignoring these values, what should happen when the file is written back to 
disk? Should these values be forced to zero, in order to conform to the 
present specification, or should they be preserved assuming that they have 
meaning to the program that originally generated the file? Again, good 
arguments can be made either way.</p>

<h3>bfOffBits</h3>

<p>The final four byte field is an integer that gives the offset of the start of 
the Pixel Data section relative to the start of the file.</p>

<h1>The Image Header</h1>

<p>There are actually several options for the Image Header, 
particularly when Versions 4 and 5 of the specification are considered. 
Limiting the discussion to Version 3, there are still two distinct options: 
one that was developed for the OS/2 BMP format and one that is for the Windows 
BMP format. The OS/2 Image Header is exactly 12 bytes long while the Windows 
Image Header is at least 40 bytes long. Fortunately, the first four bytes of 
each format (including Versions 4 and 5 and, probably, all future versions) is the length of the Image Header in bytes and therefore a simple 
examination of this value tells you which format is being used. While the 
Windows Image Header allows headers longer than 40 bytes (and this was 
supported by Windows 95), few applications ever adopted it and, once again, an 
editor that restricts itself to only working with 40-byte Image Headers will 
likely never encounter a file it can't work with.</p>

<p>The following is the format for the basic 40-byte Windows 
Image Header.</p>

</table>
<h3>biSize</h3>

<p>The size, in bytes, of the Image Header. Nearly all BMP 
files use the basic 40-byte header from the Windows Version 3 specification.</p>

<h3>biWidth</h3>

<p>This is the width of the image, in pixels.</p>

<h3>biHeight</h3>

<p>This is the height of the image, in pixels. The pixel data 
is ordered from bottom to top. If this value is negative, then the data is 
ordered from top to bottom. </p>

<h3>biPlanes</h3>

<p>This is the number of image planes in the image. It is 
always equal to 1.</p>

<h3>biBitCount</h3>

<p>This is the number of bits used to represent the data for 
each pixel. Bit Counts of 8 or less are "indexed" with the data being an 
index into the color pallete that is located stored in the Color Table 
section. Bit Counts greater than 8 are considered to be "true color" data 
with the complete color information being contained in each pixel's data. 
The overwhelming number of true color BMP files contain 24-bit images in 
which each pixel is represented by three bytes of data with one byte each 
for red, green, and blue intensities; no Color Table is present for such an 
image. Bit counts of 16 and 32 are color-masked bit fields and although all 
of the color data is present for each pixel, a set of three bit-masks, one 
for each primary color, is needed in order to determine which bits 
correspond to which colors; these bitmasks are stored in the Color Table 
section (with a default set of color masks being used if no Color Table is 
present).</p>

<h3>biCompression</h3>

<p>This value indicates what type of compression, if any, is 
used. The possible values are:</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 129px"><strong>biCompression</strong></td>
		<td><strong>Meaning</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 129px">0</td>
		<td>Uncompressed</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 129px">1</td>
		<td>RLE-8 (Usable only with 8-bit images)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 129px">2</td>
		<td>RLE-4 (Usable only with 4-bit images)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 129px">3</td>
		<td>Bitfields (Used - and required - only with 16- 
		and 32-bit images)</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h3>biSizeImage</h3>

<p>This indicates the size of the actual pixel data, in bytes, 
stored in the file. It is required for compressed image types. For 
uncompressed types (including bit-fielded images) it is generally set equal 
to zero since the size of the data can be calculated directly from the image 
size and width.</p>

<h3>biXPelsPerMeter</h3>

<p>This is the preferred horizontal resolution of the image, in 
pixels per meter, when it is printed or displayed. It is only recommendation 
to the display device and is generally equal to zero, indicating no 
preference.</p>

<h3>biYPelsPerMeter</h3>

<p>This is the preferred vertical resolution of the image, in 
pixels per meter, when it is printed or displayed. It is only recommendation 
to the display device and is generally equal to zero, indicating no 
preference.</p>

<h3>biClrUsed</h3>

<p>This value is zero except for indexed images using fewer 
than the maximum number of colors, in which case it refers to the number of 
colors contained in the Color Table. For the indexed bit depths (i.e., Bit 
Counts of 8 and smaller) the Color Table contains a list of colors to which 
the pixel data refer. The maximum number of colors that can be used is 2<sup><em>N</em></sup> 
where <em>N</em> is the value of Bit Count. For instance, 8-bit images can 
support a maximum of 256 colors. But suppose that an image only uses 47 
colors. Why store 256? More to the point, why have to make up 109 colors 
that aren't being used? Instead, simply set this parameter to 47 and store 
those 47 colors and no more. </p>

<p>In practice it is very uncommon to run across images that 
have anything other than zero for this parameter. The reason is that it is a 
simple matter to go ahead and set all of the unused colors to all zero 
(black) -- or some other color -- and store all 2<sup><em>N</em></sup> of 
them in the Color Table. The space penalty is negligible since the file size 
is dominated by the pixel data for all but the smallest images.</p>

<h3>biClrImportant</h3>

<p>This is the number of colors that are considered important 
when rendering the image. For instance, an image might contain 47 different 
colors but perhaps a reasonable image can be generated using just 13 of 
them. If the image is displayed on hardware having very limited color 
capability, say a cheap LCD panel supporting only 16 colors, then the reader 
knows that it should be able to generate an acceptable image by just using 
the first 16 colors in the Color Table. Needless to say, the important 
colors need to be stored first in the Color Table for this to work. It is 
left up to the application reading the file to determine how to map the 
"unimportant" colors into the available ones. </p>

<p>If this parameter is equal to zero, then all colors in the 
Color Table are to be considered important. </p>

<h1>The Color Table</h1>

<p>If we are dealing with images having a bit depth of 8 or less, 
then the pixel data is actually an index into a color palette. For instance, 
in a 4-bit image there are a maximum of 16 colors in the palette. If the 
data for a particular pixel is, say, 9, then the color that is used for that 
pixel is given by the tenth entry in the table (because the numbering starts 
with 0 and not 1). </p>

<p>In all versions of BMP files starting with Version 3 
(Win3x), the color entries occupy 4 bytes each so that they can be 
efficiently read and written as single 32-bit values. Taken as a single 
value, the four bytes are ordered as follows: [ZERO][RED][GREEN][BLUE]. Due 
to the Little Endian format, this means that the Blue value comes first 
followed by the green and then the red. A fourth, unused, byte comes next 
which is expected to be equal to 0.</p>

<p>If we are dealing with 16-bit or 32-bit images, then the 
Color Table contains a set of bit masks used to define which bits in the 
pixel data to associate with each color. Note that the original Version 3 
BMP format did not support these image types. Instead, these were an 
extension of the format developed for WindowsNT. For both the 16-bit and the 
32-bit variants, the color masks are 32-bits long with the green mask being 
first and the blue mask being last. In both cases the bit masks start with 
the most significant bits, meaning that for the 16-bit images the least 
significant two bytes are zero. The format requires that the bits in each 
mask be contiguous and that the masks be non-overlapping. The most common 
bit masks for 16-bit images are RGB555 and RGB565 while the most common 
bitmasks for 32-bit images are RGB888 and RGB101010.</p>

<p>If we are dealing with a 24-bit image, then there is no 
Color Table present.</p>

<h1>The Pixel Data</h1>

<p>The pixel data is organized in rows from bottom to top and, within each 
row, from left to right. Each row is called a "scan line". If the image 
height is given as a negative number, then the rows are ordered from top to 
bottom.</p>

<p>In the uncompressed formats (including the color masked formats) each 
scan line is null-padded so as to occupy an integer number of dwords (4-byte 
words). In other words, the number of bytes needed to store each scan line 
must be an even multiple of four and, if necessary, null bytes (bytes whose 
values are zero) are appended to the end of the pixel data for that row in 
order to make this so. For instance, in the 24-bit format each pixel 
requires three bytes of data. If the image is 13 pixels wide then each row 
requires 39 bytes of data and a single null byte would be appended to bring 
this total to 40.</p>

<h3>1-bit (Monochrome Bitmap)</h3>

<p>Each byte of data represents 8 pixels. The most significant bit maps to 
the left most pixel in the group of eight. Any unused bits are set to zero.</p>

<h3>4-bit (16 Color Bitmap)</h3>

<p>Each byte of data represents 2 pixels. The most significant nibble maps 
to the left most pixel in the group of two. Any unused nibble is set to 
zero.</p>

<h3>8-bit (256 Color Bitmap)</h3>

<p>Each byte represents 1 pixel. </p>

<h3>16-bit (Up to 65,536 Colors, but commonly 32,768 Colors)</h3>

<p>Each pixel is represented by two bytes. A common representation is RGB555 
which allocates 5 bits to each color allowing for 32K colors while leaving 
one bit unused. Since the eye is most sensitive to green, another common 
representation is RGB565 which allocates this unused bit to the green 
component </p>

<h3>24-bit (16,777,216 Colors)</h3>

<p>Each pixel is represented by three bytes. The first byte gives the 
intensity of the red component, the second byte gives the intensity of the 
green component, and the third byte gives the intensity of the blue 
component.</p>

<h3>32-bit (Up to 4,294,967,296 Colors, but commonly 1,073,741,824 or 
16,777,216 Colors)</h3>

<p>Each pixel is represented by four bytes. Even though this means that over 
four billion colors could be represented, very few display devices are 
capable of such resolution. However, it can be desirable to store images 
with such high resolution so that significant processing can be performed on 
the data without significant degradation building up from accumulated 
round-off errors. Even so, it is generally sufficient to only maintain an 
additional two bits of information per pixel, so the RGB101010 
representation allocates 10 bits to each color. Another common 
representation is the RGB888 which simply uses a 32-bit format to store 
24-bit images in order to leverage the ability of the processor to work with 
data in 32-bit chunks more efficiently.</p>
