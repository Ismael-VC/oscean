<p>What are computers for, anyway?</p>

<p>Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention. I think of computers like a sort of telescope, but to observe immaterial objects. Mathematical beauty is the aesthetic pleasure derived from the abstractness, or orderliness of mathematics. Similarly to how one might enjoy spending time studying venation patterns, we can imagine a device to explore procedural music and parametric illustration.</p>

<p>This romantic vision of the <a href='anarchy.html'>luddite</a>, potentially emancipating, power of computing was promptly smothered by military drones, surveillance hardware and the advertisement machinery. Suffice to say, that nowadays, to most of my friends, computing evokes either encroaching social networks or the drudgery of data entry.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm making it more difficult than necessary by using the term <i>personal computer</i>, and not finding a more apt word to describe what I have in mind. This devlog is a summary of notes on the creation of a personal computer built upon the virtual machine documented in the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>previous post</a>.</p>

<h3>I. Personal</h3>

<p>We must consider the whole enterprise of designing and documenting Varvara to be a sort of <i>model</i> that others could adapt to their own <a href='marvelous_pursuit.html'>designs</a>, a manifesto calling on individuals to conjure up their own vision of a computing machine, tailored to suit their own needs. The purpose of this document is not to gather would-be users of this specific system, but instead remind each other that the key to permaculture is to create resilience through a diversification of methods.</p>

<p>I am certain that making something unique by way of customization is necessary for care, <i>for when the unique breaks, </i><a href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/that-which-is-unique-breaks' target='_blank'>we might mend</a>. I often think back on how, in the movie Hackers(1995), each character had their own laptop launch sequence reflecting parts of their aesthetics. &mdash; A far cry from today's <a href='commodity.html'>disposable laptops</a>, each equally adorned of <i>proprietary services</i> stickers.</p>

<p>For mending to even be envisaged, one must be able to generally understand that which needs to be mended; a venture which, thanks to the ever complexifying stack upon which modern computing is built, will have you promptly laughed out of the room. But just for the sake of our talking about virtual machines, our required understanding of the system shall end at its bytecode.</p>

<p>A side-effect of working from within unique computing environments is that looking for generic solutions is often more impractical than solving the problem head on. By that, I mean by that the solution needs to be adapted to the specifics of the virtual system, and this in turn develops understanding and care.</p>

<h3>II. Computer</h3>

<p>Varvara is a definition of potential I/O communications with the Uxn virtual machine. The VM can communicate with up to 16 devices at once, but has no knowledge of what a screen or a keyboard might be, these devices are what make up the Varvara computer.</p>

<q>Uxn is to Varvara, what the 6502 is to the Classic Nintendo.</q>

<p>When it came time to find out how I might want to interact with this computer, I started with a terminal, it seemed as good a place as any to start off from. The terminal communication allowed me to leverage the power of my current host OS to further develop the system. </p>

<img src='../media/generic/uxn.devices.png' width='350'/>

<p>As the system began to take shape, I considered that possibly someday I may loose my sight, or the use of my hands, or I may become deaf. As I assembled the various parts of the system, I wondered how I might replace one device for another in the future, and how I might adapt each device to my changing needs. I left some blank spaces to be filled at a later time, should I need them.</p>

<h3>III. The Screen as Example</h3>

<p>I heard tales from the fabled era of computing when people would create simple operating systems over the course of a weekend or two, it inspired me to try and find the building blocks needed to make this process more approachable. I decided to use the screen to demonstrate some of the ideas explored in Varvara, but I could have as easily picked another device for they are all designed similarly.</p>

<p>We'll begin with drawing a <b>pixel</b>, from which lines, letters, shapes and other primitives can be derived.</p>

<p>One of the many things that <a href='plan9.html'>Plan 9</a> has made quite clear to me, was that interface design can be fun. An easy access to a pixel buffer makes all the difference for fostering an ecosystem of personalized applications. </p>

<p>The Famicom's picture processing unit uses little 8x8 tiles, which fit neatly in 8 bytes of memory, where each byte is a row, and each monochromatic pixel is a bit. This tile size is small enough that someone with a pen and paper could mentally decipher its content, and large enough to contain a letter or a pictogram.</p>

<p>The Neo Geo's graphics processor assembles tiles into larger sprites by drawing them in a sequence, either vertically or horizontally.</p>

<p>We can draw a 2x2 picture by sending a single extra drawing instruction for the bottom row of the picture, we can leverage this sprite drawing system to draw larger real-time graphics with very little boilerplate and change in bytecode size.</p>
