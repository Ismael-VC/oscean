<p>What are computers for, anyway?</p>

<p>Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention. I think of computers like you would a telescope, but to observe immaterial objects. Mathematical beauty is the aesthetic pleasure derived from the abstractness, or orderliness of mathematics. Similarly to how one might enjoy spending time studying venation patterns, we can imagine a device to explore procedural music and parametric illustration.</p>

<p>This romantic vision of the liddite, potentially emancipating, power of computing was prompty squelched by military drones, surveillance hardware and the advertisement machinery. Suffice to say, that nowadays, to most of my friends, computing evokes either encroaching social networks or the drugery of data entry.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm making it more diffult than necessary by using the term <i>personal computer</i>, and not finding a more capable word to describe what I have in mind.</p>

<p>I am certain that making something unique by way of customization is necessary for care, <i>for when the unique breaks, </i><a href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/that-which-is-unique-breaks' target='_blank'>we might mend</a>. I often think back on how, in the movie Hackers(1995), each character had their own laptop launch sequence reflecting parts of their aesthetics. A far cry from the NodeJS hexagonal stickers found on every second laptop today.</p>

<h3>I. Drawing a Pixel</h3>

<p>I heard tales from the fabled era of computing when people would create simple operating systems over the course of a weekend or two, it inspired me to try and find the building blocks needed to make this process more approachable. But first, <b>a pixel</b>, from the pixel, various lines, letters, shapes and other primitives can be derived.</p>

#0010 .Screen/x DEO2   <span style='float:right; color:#777'>a000 1080 2837</span>
#0020 .Screen/y DEO2   <span style='float:right; color:#777'>a000 2080 2a37</span>
#01 .Screen/pixel DEO  <span style='float:right; color:#777'>a001 2e17</span>
</pre>

<p>One of the many things that <a href='plan9.html'>Plan 9</a> has made quite clear to me, was that interface design can be fun. An easy access to a pixel buffer makes all the difference to fostering an ecosystem of personalized applications. </p>

<h3>II. Drawing 64 Pixels</h3>

<p>The Famicom picture processing unit uses little 8x8 tiles, which fit neatly in 8 bytes of memory, where each byte is a row, and each pixel is a bit.</p><ul></ul><p><b>Incoming</b>: <a href="devlog.html" class="parent">devlog</a> <a href="uxn_devlog.html">uxn devlog</a> </p></main>
