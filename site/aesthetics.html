<p>The analysis of <a href='horaire.html'>personal statistics</a> recorded through years of <a href='routine.html'>daily journaling</a>, revealed that <a href='travel.html'>travel</a> converts into the most <a href='horaire.html'>hours of inspiration</a>. From this insight, I have oriented my creative work toward becoming a <a href='nomad.html'>nomad</a>.</p>

<p>Multi-tasking revealed itself to have a negative impact on my productivity. Working within the confines of a single medium, would convert into long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period of a year showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad — showed an improvement in the realization of <i>Arts & Sciences</i>.</p>

<p>Learning to solve problems directly produced more sustained periods of output in comparison to searching for solutions which makes one dependant on the availability of material. Building specific <a href='tools.html'>tools</a> mostly returned higher performance than <a href='about.html'>learning general purpose tools</a>.</p>

<q>Optimizing toward the <b>need for less revenue</b> has yielded much better results than optimizing toward the generation of more.</q>

<p>Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always converted into better output, against acting impulsively and making possible accidental steps away from one's goals.</p>

<p>I have kept journals recording the oscillation of <b>Efficiency</b> and <b>Effectiveness</b>, and used this data to optimize and navigate my own personal tempers of productivity. Based on previously recorded patterns, I assign to myself each day a single task to complete. The task is chosen specifically to utilize the optimal amount of available stamina.</p>

<p>When a workday ends before the daily task is completed, the day was a planning failure; and the task is broken down into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When a task is completed too early, the day is also a planning failure.</p>

<p>I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a task to complete & and a lesson to learn, and I do not go to sleep until I have <a href='routine.html'>logged the results</a>. The tasks are selected in the following order: I first address the problems that slow me down, the things I find lacking in my life and the answers to questions that occupies my mind.</p>

<q>You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.</q>
