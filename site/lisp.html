<main><h2>Lisp is a family of programming languages recognizable by its iconic
parenthesized prefix notation.</h2>

<p>Operations in Lisp use the format <code>(* 5 5)</code>, as opposed to the
infix <a href='notation.html'>notation</a> <code>(5 * 5)</code>. A pair of parentheses indicates one step
of calculation.</p>

<p>A function name comes after the open parenthesis followed by
arguments. Atoms are tokens in a list separated by spaces, tabs and
newlines.</p>

<h3>Data Types</h3>

<p>A <b>number</b> is a signed integer in a machine specific finite range, and the
representation of a number is a seq uence of decimal digits, optionally
preceded by a sign.</p>

<pre>
45
+137
-27</pre>

<p>A <b>symbol</b> is represented by a finite sequence of characters, it is not possible
for the user to type symbols which begin as though they were numbers, although
digits may appear later in a symbol that begins with, say, a letter. </p>

<pre>
Hello
Hello-world
x32 </pre>

<p>A <b>pair</b> consists of two component called the head and the tail. The
components of a pair may be any type of value, including pairs, so that pairing
may be used to construct arbitrarily large data structures. </p>

<pre>
( 45 . Hello )
( foo . bar )
( -12 . ( 34 . 56 ) )
</pre>

<p>A <b>function</b> is a value which may be applied to arguments, to yield a
value which depends only on the function and the arguments to which it is
applied. Given an expression, <b>quote</b> returns that expression as a value.</p>

<pre>
(QUOTE 12)
(REM (QUOTE 19) (QUOTE 24))
(MUL (QUOTE 2) (ADD (QUOTE 1) X))
</pre>

<h3>Built-ins</h3>

<p>A <b>lambda</b> expression allows to name sub-expressions, given an argument list and an expression, returns them as a function.:</p>

<pre>
(LAMBDA (X Y) (ADD X Y))
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, the <b>let</b> expression can also associate a name to an
expression, given an expression with declarations (as named expressions visible
in the expression) returns its value:</p>

<pre>
(LET (QUOTE (aleph 1234)))
</pre>

<p>The following expression has value <b>True(T)</b> if the value of the
expression is an <b>atom</b>, a number or a symbol, or has value
<b>False(F)</b> otherwise. </p>

<pre>(ATOM (QUOTE 123))</pre>

<p>The <b>equality</b> of two atomic expressions may be tested by an expression
of the following form, and result in a value either T or F provided that the
values of the expressions being compared are both atoms, and either they are
both the same number, or they are both the same symbol:</p>

<pre>
(LAMBDA (X) (EQ (QUOTE foo) X))
</pre>

<p>Given three expressions returns the value of the second if the value of the
first is True, otherwise returns the value of the third.</p>

<pre>
(IF 
	(EQ (QUOTE 16) X)
	(QUOTE EQUAL16)
	(QUOTE NOT-EQUAL16))
</pre>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>car</b>: Returns a pair's first value.</li>
	<li><b>cdr</b>: Returns a pair's second value.</li>
	<li><b>atom</b>: Returns T if its value is atomic.</li>
	<li><b>cons</b>: Returns a value pair consisting of two expressions.</li>
	<li><b>eq</b>: Returns T if two expressions are equal.</li>
	<li><b>add</b>: Returns the sum of two numeric values.</li>
	<li><b>sub</b>: Returns the difference of two numeric values.</li>
	<li><b>mul</b>: Returns the product of two numeric values.</li>
	<li><b>div</b>: Returns the quotient of two numeric values.</li>
	<li><b>rem</b>: Returns the remainder of two numeric values.</li>
	<li><b>leq</b>: Returns T if the first value is less or equal to the second.</li>
</ul>

<q>Writing eval required inventing a notation representing Lisp functions as
Lisp data, and such a notation was devised for the purposes of the paper with
no thought that it would be used to express Lisp programs in practice. </q>

<h2>A virtual machine intended as a target for functional programming language compilers.</h2>

<p>The SECD machine is defined with a set of transitions between its four components:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A stack register holding a list of intermediate results.</li>
	<li>An environment register holding the current environment.</li>
	<li>A control register holding a list of control directives.</li>
	<li>A dump register holding a list of triples. Each triple contains snapshots of the stack, environment, and control registers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stacks</h3>

<p>Like all internal data-structures, the stack is a list, with the S register pointing at the list's head or beginning. Due to the list structure, the stack need not be a continuous block of memory, so stack space is available as long as there is a single free memory cell. Even when all cells have been used, garbage collection may yield additional free memory. Obviously, specific implementations of the SECD structure can implement the stack as a canonical stack structure, thus improving the overall efficiency of the virtual machine, provided that a strict bound be put on the dimension of the stack.</p>
<p>The C register points at the head of the code or instruction list that will be evaluated. Once the instruction there has been executed, the C is pointed at the next instruction in the listâ€”it is similar to an instruction pointer (or program counter) in conventional machines, except that subsequent instructions are always specified during execution and are not by default contained in subsequent memory locations, as is the case with the conventional machines.</p>
<p>The current variable environment is managed by the E register, which points at a list of lists. Each individual list represents one environment level: the parameters of the current function are in the head of the list, variables that are free in the current function, but bound by a surrounding function, are in other elements of E.</p>
<p>The dump, at whose head the D register points, is used as temporary storage for values of the other registers, for example during function calls. It can be likened to the return stack of other machines. </p>

<ul>
	<li><kbd>s</kbd> Stack used for evaluation of expressions.</li>
	<li><kbd>e</kbd> Environment used to store the current value list.</li>
	<li><kbd>c</kbd> Control used to store the instructions.</li>
	<li><kbd>d</kbd> Dump used to store suspended invocation context.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Primitives</h3>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Basic Instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>NIL</th><td>pushes a nil pointer onto the stack</td></tr>
	<tr><th>LD</th><td>pushes the value of a variable onto the stack. The variable is indicated by the argument, a pair.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>LDC</th><td>pushes a constant argument onto the stack</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Branching instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>SEL</th><td>expects two list arguments, and pops a value from the stack. The first list is executed if the popped value was non-nil, the second list otherwise. Before one of these list pointers is made the new C, a pointer to the instruction following s e l sel is saved on the dump.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>JOIN</th><td>pops a list reference from the dump and makes this the new value of C. This instruction occurs at the end of both alternatives of a sel.</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Non-recursive function instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>LDF</th><td>takes one list argument representing a function. It constructs a closure (a pair containing the function and the current environment) and pushes that onto the stack.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>AP</th><td>pops a closure and a list of parameter values from the stack. The closure is applied to the parameters by installing its environment as the current one, pushing the parameter list in front of that, clearing the stack, and setting C to the closure's function pointer. The previous values of S, E, and the next value of C are saved on the dump.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>RTN</th><td>pops one return value from the stack, restores S, E, and C from the dump, and pushes the return value onto the now-current stack.</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Recursive function instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>RAP</th><td>works like a p ap, only that it replaces an occurrence of a dummy environment with the current one, thus making recursive functions possible</td></tr>
	<tr><th>DUM</th><td>pushes a "dummy", an empty list, in front of the environment list.</td></tr>

<h3>A. Push Objects to Stack</h3>

<p>Compilation Rules:</p>
<ul>
	<li>(a) A nil is compiled to (NIL)</li>
	<li>(b) A number (or a constant) x is compiled to (LDC x)</li>
	<li>(c) An identifier is compiled to (LD (i.j)) where (i.j) is an index into stack e.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stack Operations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NIL	s e (NIL.c) d -> (nil.s) e c d</li>
	<li>LDC	s e (LDC x.c) d -> (x.s) e c d</li>
	<li>LD	s e (LD (i.j).c) d -> (locate((i.j),e).s) e c d</li>
</ul>

<p>"Locate" is an auxiliary function. It returns the jth element of the ith sublist in e.</p>

<p>Note: roughly, e is a list of sublists each of which is a list of
actual parameters. Thus, e corresponds to the value list in
our interpreter. There will be no name list here, as each occurrence
of a formal parameter will be compiled to LD (i.j) and by
locate(i.j) the corresponding actual parameter is found.</p>

<p>"The Mechanical Evaluation of Expressions" by PeterLandin is the original paper that describes the SECD machine.</p>
