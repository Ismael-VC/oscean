<main><h2>A common trait of all dialects of LISP is the S-expression.</h2>

<p>Operations in Lisp use the <a href='notation.html'>prefix notation</a>
<code>(* 5 5)</code>, as opposed to the typical infix notation <code>(5 * 5)</code>.
A pair of parentheses indicates one step of calculation. This page
will document a portable, lexically scoped, purely functional subset of
Lisp, sometimes called <i>Pure Lisp</i>, which does <b>not</b> allow for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unbound and global variables</li>
	<li>Destructive data operations.</li>
	<li>GOTOs, and side effects.</li>
	<li>Explicit pointers and dereferencing.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Lisp, a function name comes after the open parenthesis followed by
arguments. Atoms are tokens in a list separated by spaces, tabs and
newlines.</p>

<h3>Data Types</h3>

<p>A <b>number</b> is a signed integer in a machine-specific finite range, and the
representation of a number is a sequence of decimal digits, optionally
preceded by a sign.</p>

<pre>
45
+137
-27</pre>

<p>A <b>symbol</b> is represented by a finite sequence of characters, it is not
possible for the user to type symbols which begin as though they were numbers,
although digits may appear later in a symbol that begins with, say, a letter.
</p>

<pre>
Hello
Hello-world
x32 </pre>

<p>A <b>pair</b> consists of two component called the head and the tail. The
components of a pair may be any type of value, including pairs, so that pairing
may be used to construct arbitrarily large data structures. </p>

<pre>
( 45 . Hello )
( foo . bar )
( -12 . ( 34 . 56 ) )
</pre>

<p>A <b>function</b> is a value which may be applied to arguments, to yield a
value which depends only on the function and the arguments to which it is
applied. Given an expression, <b>quote</b> returns that expression as a value.</p>

<pre>
(QUOTE 12)
(REM (QUOTE 19) (QUOTE 24))
(MUL (QUOTE 2) (ADD (QUOTE 1) X))
</pre>

<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>A <b>lambda</b> expression allows to name sub-expressions, given an argument
list and an expression, returns them as a function:</p>

<pre>
(LAMBDA (X Y) (ADD X Y))
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, the <b>let</b> expression can also associate a name to an
expression, given an expression with declarations (as named expressions visible
in the expression) returns its value:</p>

<pre>
(LET (QUOTE (aleph 1234)))
</pre>

<p>The following expression has value <b>True(T)</b> if the value of the
expression is an <b>atom</b>, a number or a symbol, or has value
<b>False(F)</b> otherwise. </p>

<pre>
(ATOM (QUOTE 12)) <i>; T</i>
(ATOM (CONS (QUOTE 12) (QUOTE 34))) <i>; F</i>
</pre>

<p>The <b>equality</b> of two atomic expressions may be tested by an expression
of the following form, and result in a value either T or F provided that the
values of the expressions being compared are both atoms, and either they are
both the same number, or they are both the same symbol:</p>

<pre>
(LAMBDA (X) (EQ (QUOTE foo) X))
</pre>

<p>Given three expressions returns the value of the second if the value of the
first is True, otherwise returns the value of the third.</p>

<pre>
(IF
	(EQ (QUOTE 16) X)
	(QUOTE EQUAL16)
	(QUOTE NOT-EQUAL16))
</pre>

<h3>Programs</h3>

<p>A Pure Lisp program is either a LET, LETREC or LAMBDA expression. The main
difference between LET and LETREC is that, with LETREC, the defined symbols are
also visible in the expressions from the list of cons pairs, not just from the
main expression. The values of LET and LETREC expressions are values of their
first argument, calculated after substitutions of symbols with approrpiate
expressions are made.</p>

<pre>
(LETREC greeting
	(greeting LAMBDA (X) (CONS (QUOTE Hello) X)))
</pre>

<p>This program could also be written as a simple lambda expression. In both
cases, if the symbol "Machiavelli" is used as argument, the program will
evaluate to the following pair:</p>

<pre>
(LAMBDA (X) (CONS (QUOTE Hello) X)) <i>; ( Hello . Machiavelli )</i>
</pre>

<p>Functions created as lambdas can be used in other parts of the program as
follows:</p>

<pre>
(LETREC program
	(program LAMBDA (X) (incr X))
	(incr LAMBDA (X) (ADD X (QUOTE 1))))
</pre>

<q>Writing eval required inventing a notation representing Lisp functions as
Lisp data, and such a notation was devised for the purposes of the paper with
no thought that it would be used to express Lisp programs in practice. </q>

<h2>An abstract machine intended as a target for functional programming language
compilers.</h2>

<p>The SECD is a stack-based runtime with a core of 10 opcodes defined with a set
of transitions between its four components. Functions take their arguments from
the stack. The arguments to built-in instructions are encoded immediately after
them in the instruction stream. If <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> are both
empty, overall evaluation has completed with the result on <kbd>S</kbd>. </p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Stack</b> <kbd>S</kbd> register points to a list of intermediate results.</li>
	<li><b>Environment</b> <kbd>E</kbd> register points to the current environment.</li>
	<li><b>Control</b> <kbd>C</kbd> register points a location in the program.</li>
	<li><b>Dump</b> <kbd>D</kbd> register points to a list of triples. Each triple contains snapshots of the stack, environment, and control registers.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
( LAMBDA ( X ) ( ADD ( QUOTE 1 ) X ) )
</pre>

<p>If we compile the <a href='lisp.html'>Lisp</a> program above, the
<code>.secd</code> representation of the incrementing lambda program is as
follows in which each number is one of the abstract machine opcode:</p>

<pre>
( 3 ( 2 1 1 ( 0 . 0 ) 15 5 ) 4 21 )
</pre>

<p>If we decode the operation numbers to their mnemonics:</p>
<pre>
( LDF ( LDC 1 LD ( 0 . X ) ADD RTN ) AP BRK )
</pre>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Basic Instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>0</th><th>NIL</th><td>Pushes a nil pointer onto the stack</td></tr>
	<tr><th>1</th><th>LD</th><td>Pushes the value of a variable onto the stack. The variable is indicated by the argument, a pair.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>2</th><th>LDC</th><td>Pushes a constant argument onto the stack</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Non-recursive function instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>3</th><th>LDF</th><td>Takes one list argument representing a function. It constructs a closure (a pair containing the function and the current environment) and pushes that onto the stack.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>4</th><th>AP</th><td>Pops a closure and a list of parameter values from the stack. The closure is applied to the parameters by installing its environment as the current one, pushing the parameter list in front of that, clearing the stack, and setting C to the closure's function pointer. The previous values of S, E, and the next value of C are saved on the dump.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>5</th><th>RTN</th><td>Pops one return value from the stack, restores S, E, and C from the dump, and pushes the return value onto the now-current stack.</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Recursive function instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>7</th><th>RAP</th><td>Works like a p ap, only that it replaces an occurrence of a dummy environment with the current one, thus making recursive functions possible</td></tr>
	<tr><th>6</th><th>DUM</th><td>Pushes a "dummy", an empty list, in front of the environment list.</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Branching instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>8</th><th>SEL</th><td>Expects two list arguments, and pops a value from the stack. The first list is executed if the popped value was non-nil, the second list otherwise. Before one of these list pointers is made the new C, a pointer to the instruction following s e l sel is saved on the dump.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>9</th><th>JOIN</th><td>Pops a list reference from the dump and makes this the new value of C. This instruction occurs at the end of both alternatives of a sel.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Like all internal data-structures, the stack is a list, with the <kbd>S</kbd>
register pointing at the list's head. Due to the list structure, the stack need
not be a continuous block of memory, so stack space is available as long as
there is a single free memory cell. Even when all cells have been used, garbage
collection may yield additional free memory. </p>

<p>The current variable environment is managed by the <kbd>E</kbd> register, which
points at a list of lists. Each individual list represents one environment
level: the parameters of the current function are in the head of the list,
variables that are free in the current function, but bound by a surrounding
function, are in other elements of E.</p>

<p>The <kbd>C</kbd> register points at the head of the instruction list that will
be evaluated. Once the instruction there has been executed, the pointer is pointed at
the next instruction in the list. It is similar to an instruction pointer (or
program counter) in conventional machines, except that subsequent instructions
are always specified during execution and are not by default contained in
subsequent memory locations, as is the case with the conventional machines.</p>

<p>The <kbd>D</kbd> register, at whose head the register points, is used as
temporary storage for values of the other registers, for example during
function calls. It can be likened to the return stack of other machines. </p>

<table border='1'>
