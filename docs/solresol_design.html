The words in Solresol consist of sequences of notes.
Sudre planned to use seven words of one note, 
49 words of two notes, 336 words of three notes, 2268 words of
four notes, and 9072 words of five notes.

<P>
Words need to be separated in some way if they are to be decoded
uniquely; for this reason Sudre decided that word boundaries would be
denoted with brief pauses.   This requirement tends to break up
the "melody" in an unpleasant way.

<P>
It is also interesting to note that Sudre didn't use all combinations of
three and four notes.  It has been suggested that this was intentional, in
order to avoid repititious sequences of notes.  In fact, in the information
I have, only 42 two-note words are defined---the seven repititious ones
are omitted.

<P>
Combinations of one or two notes form the participles and pronouns, while
three-note words are used for the most frequent words.
There are seven classes of four note words, called keys, according to
the initial note.  For example, the key of <B>do</B> contains words which
represent the physical and moral aspects of man.
Finally, combinations of five notes furnish the names of the three
categories: animal, vegetable and mineral.

<P>
To allow future expansion, Sudre included an encoding of the letters of
the alphabet.

<P>
Grammatical categories may be distinguished by the position of an accent
over the notes, which means the note should be lengthened to indicate
stress.  The verb is
unstressed throughout, the noun is stressed on the first note, the
adjective on the next-to-last, and the adverb on the last.
The feminine is also marked by final stress.

<P>
The opposite of an idea is often expressed by reversing the order
of the notes in a word.
