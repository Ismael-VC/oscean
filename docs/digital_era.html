</p>

<p>
Astronomers gather information from the start of the universe.
Paleontologists gather fossils that are millions of years old. Information
has lasted for very long periods of time. The information plate on the
Voyager spacecraft will last for a similar period into the future now that
the craft has left the solar system. This paper reviews some of the issues
and perspectives of planning to store information and make it accessible on
this time scale. The extremes of this review may help to clarify similar
issues for shorter preservation intervals. Long term preservation must
include a plan for preserving meta data as well as data. This paper also
discusses the need for emulators to permanently preserve the essence of the
machines that execute the algorithms that convert abstract data into
viewable images. We will need emulators to reproduce chronisticly accurate
images printed from common word processing programs. While these files stay
the same over time, each new release of software interprets them in a
slightly different way, creating different page images for viewing. Beyond
the mechanics, we must also address the need to move up the scale:
detectable differences-bits-data-information-knowledge-wisdom at any given
point in the future.
</p>

<p>
<h2 align="CENTER">Introduction</h2>
</p>

<p>
We now have the promise of preserving information forever(1)(2). Twenty
years ago the Voyager spacecraft was launched with a gold plaque that the
engineers estimated would last over 1 billion years (3). We now have many
digital files that have been created with the intention of permanent
preservation. We have also accumulated a history of managing those
files(4). Recent revelations about the need for meta-data and data
migration for these files are mileposts on the road to permanent
preservation, not roadblocks. In almost all cases, digital emulation will
provide the final key for assured reproduction forever.
</p>

<p>
Even if we can preserve information forever, to succeed in our quest to
pass our record on to the future, we must stand simultaneously in the
paradigm of technology, and the paradigm of creation, the creation of that
which we seek to preserve. We must do so because our ability to preserve,
and the ability of future interpreters to make use of that which we have
preserved, depends on creation. Creation is an ability we have, but may
never be able to understand or reproduce, in contrast to our ability to
understand and reproduce our technology.
</p>

<p>
What we do, in our preserving, will change what we seek to preserve, that
is, our society, our civilization(5). Making our civilization aware of
these possible changes is the professional responsibility of archivists,
librarians, and museum curators, just as preservation is our professional
responsibility.
</p>

<p>
This paper is divided into four parts. The first reviews the goals of
archivists, librarians, and museum curators and presents those goals as the
basis for discussions on how to use digital technology to achieve those
goals. The second part describes the technology of permanent preservation.
The third part attempts to describe creation, as that which is embodied in
the materials we seek to preserve, as the creative act that preservation
is, and as the creation that will be done in the future to make use of
preserved materials. The fourth part describes what might be our
responsibility for the consequences of perfect, permanent, all-encompassing
preservation.

<p>
<h2 align="CENTER">1. How We Preserve</h2>
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.1 Introduction</h3>
</p>

<p>
The function of libraries, archives, and museums are well defined and are
easily extended to make use of newly available technology. Many of the
problems attributed to technology are problems that have previously been
worked out in libraries, archives, and museums and merely need to be
applied in the new context. Choosing what to preserve, preserving as much
as can be afforded, using the most economical means, and operating in a
passive, low profile manner appear to be important techniques when applying
technology to existing preservation problems.
</p>

<p>
Knowing why we preserve information, and how the task has been carried out
thus far, can help us to make our choices of technology and procedures in a
future world that is both limitless and increasingly defined and recorded.
</p>

<p>
All current library, archives, and museum policies and procedures make
sense, because they evolved to fit their environment -- our civilization
and society. Not many new ones are needed.
</p>

<p>
Straying from the policies and procedures that have evolved over time is
expensive, often prohibitively expensive, to the point of reducing the
number of items that can be accessioned (adding to an archives) (2). An
example of a departure from the underlying passive model of archives is the
proposed practice of periodic migration of files(4) to make them compatible
with current computer software. Another example is an over emphasis on
links with the goal of matching the richness found on the internet(4), more
than is required in paper archives.
</p>

<p>
Preservation is not a solution to a technical problem, it is the practice
of archives administration, museum curatorship, and librarianship.
Preserving is not merely copying. Preservation is an act of creation, of
creating an authentic, accessible record by accessioning the materials sent
to archives. These materials are the record of that which we seek to
preserve, our civilization.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.2 Libraries, Museums, and Archives</h3>
</p>

<p>
Archives and libraries are very similar. Archives place preservation over
access and libraries place access over preservation. If preservation and
access are both available universally and at a very low cost, the goals of
archives and libraries begin to merge. Museums also seek to preserve a
record of the past and make it accessible. Access to museum materials can
be improved by providing a digital record of the materials. Like archives
and libraries, museums will, over the long run, have to deal with the fact
that eventually the physical artifacts will disappear, leaving only the
digital copies.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.3 Libraries</h3>
</p>

<p>
In libraries we preserve interpretations. Interpretations are creations
that describe what has been done and creations that form the framework for
what will be done in the future.
</p>

<p>
The transition from an oral tradition to a written tradition, and the
transition from manuscript to book is similar to transition from book to
computer. Librarianship was around for parts of the first transition, and
all of the second one. Librarianship can contribute many solutions to the
third, the transition to the use of the computer.
</p>

<p>
Libraries have had to pick which books to keep and make available. When
libraries can store unlimited volumes of many types of materials digitally,
libraries will have a responsibility to help society decide what not to
keep, and what to make it illegal to keep, if anything.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.4 Museums</h3>
</p>

<p>
In museums we preserve physical objects, as a means for forming a
connection with the creators of the objects, their ideas, their creations.
Plants, animals, and other naturally occurring objects may also be
selected. In addition to illustrating an evolutionary or geologic process,
these naturally occurring objects also reflect the creativity of the person
who found and selected the objects. Access to the physical objects provides
the most primary source for checking the fidelity of data and notes, stored
in archives, that are derived from the physical objects and the
interpretations, stored in libraries, that are about the physical objects.
</p>

<p>
Digital scans of the objects, both surface scans and internal composition
scans done with procedures such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NMR
or MRI)(6) will provide future access to the objects when the objects
themselves have deteriorated. While no analog of an object, manuscript,
original document, or book is as good as access to the original, the
analogs can protect the originals from unnecessary access. The digital
analogs of objects can provide better access to the originals objects, than
the original objects themselves can provide, when the original objects have
deteriorated or been otherwise compromised by the vulnerability of their
physical nature. In archives and libraries, this point is often illustrated
by microfilm or xerographic copies that provide the only access to original
records that have been destroyed.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.5 Archives</h3>
</p>

<p>
Archives preserve the information artifacts, the raw information, the bits,
the data, the information, the knowledge, the wisdom that was created by,
available to, and used by the people who created. Archivists create an
archives from what would otherwise be the mere collecting and preserving of
documents. Archivists serve the goals of their archives by their decisions
on what is chosen, what is organized, what finding aids and links are
provided, what is explained and interpreted, and what is presented to later
generations.
</p>

<p>
Archives provide the raw materials for validation of interpretations
preserved in libraries. Archives also support research being done to create
new interpretation of events documented by archival materials. Using the
resources of archives, researchers can reduce their dependence on previous
interpretations and can perhaps be more accurate in their new
interpretations.
</p>

<p>
Archival preservation does not mean 'keep-a-long-time', or forever, it
means everything archives are today: the preservation of original materials
and the maintaining of original materials in their original form, where the
creator of the materials picks the format of the materials, not the
archivist. When a record is accessioned, added to an archives, all possible
provenance (the order of the records as defined by the creator of the
records and the subsequent history and circumstances of the record)(2) is
preserved and linked. Even if the provenance is not complete, the record
can be preserved. Provenance easily encompasses the concepts of meta-data
and emulation described in this paper.
</p>

<p>
The professional act of accessioning, recording, and maintaining the chain
of custody of an accessioned fonds (record series)(2) covers digital
signatures, seals, and encryption. You can not know what you preserved
unless a person, an archivist, declares that you have what you think you
have. The archivist provides their professional guarantee that no illicit
alteration was made, no sham was substituted, at any point in the process
of accessioning and custody. An archivist generally cannot inspect
individual items in accessioned fonds, but individual items are protected
by archivists during and after accessioning. Archivists can sign their
work, accessioning, with their digital seals. This care, and this
professional guarantee, means that the act of preservation is the creative
act of a person. Preservation is not mere copying.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.6 Preserving Accountability</h3>
</p>

<p>
In addition to an archivist's accountability for carrying out their
professional tasks, archivists are also charged with preserving a record of
the accountability of the organization of which the archives are part. This
further distinguishes the archival profession from a collection of
technologies and techniques.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.7 A Proven Archives Technique Applied in 
the Digital Age</h3>
</p>

<p>
Most commercial issues disappear when records are sealed for 100 years.
</p>

<p>
Archivists have the practice of sealing records for a period of time. This
would work well for preserving the digital content of copyrighted
materials. Submission for copyright could include the requirement to submit
both a digital raster image and a digital source document and their digital
provenance. The digital information could then be sealed for the length of
the copyright. From a purely preservation standpoint this would completely
solve the problem.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.8 Development of Digital Media to Meet Traditional 
Archives Requirements</h3>
</p>

<p>
Archival integrity suggests that digital media, with perhaps more
appropriate properties than currently available media, might be created for
use in archives. Because all document management systems first write their
documents on magnetic disk, archives have no need for the high data rates
or short sectors now provided by optical disk venders. This is because the
a magnetic disk buffer can free the archival disk system from the
requirement to keep up with high speed input scanners or frequent
researcher access. Disk media storage systems can be developed for archives
that are significantly larger in capacity, lower in accesses per unit time,
and much less vulnerable to environmental variables, than the media used in
commercial document management systems. An example of this type of media is
presented in section 2 of this paper.(7)
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.9 Professional Responsibility</h3>
</p>

<p>
Given the role of the their professions, librarians, museum curators, and
archivists have a professional responsibility to know the technology and
how to employ it as needed to carry out their professional duties.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">1.10 Summary</h3>
</p>

<p>
Tools and techniques that are well known to librarians, archivists, and
museum curators are very effective in solving digital preservation
problems. This is particularly true in the areas of making accessioning
decision, allocating scarce resources, and solving organizational problems.
</p>

<p>
<h2 align="CENTER">2. The Technology</h2>
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.1 Introduction</h3>
</p>

<p>
It appears that the technology will soon be ready to do everything we might
ask for. We have identified fossils that are 3 billion years old, providing
a precedent for long term preservation of information(8). We routinely
build components and record information at the resolving limit of visible
light. Nanotechnology (9) promises molecular machines that operate under
computer control on the same molecular scale we personally employ to
consume food and move about. Physical and molecular structures can be
designed for any length of statistical longevity(9). In short, we now have
solid theories from which we can begin to build mechanisms and structures
to preserve information forever.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.2 We First Preserved Information Forever 
Twenty Years Ago</h3>
</p>

<p>
We now have the ability to preserve information forever on a limited scale.
Twenty years ago the Voyager spacecraft was launched with a gold plaque
that the engineers estimated would last over 1 billion years (3). The life
of the plaque is limited by the diffusion of gold into space.(3) The plaque
was designed to be read by other, non-human civilizations and was intended
to give an overview of our world. The plaque is part of our civilization's
journey to become independent of our planet and its vulnerability to
asteroids and other threats. The 1 billion year estimate is conservative.
The plaque will probably survive the end of our sun in 5 billion years
because the Voyager spacecraft has now left our solar system. The plaque is
beyond our current means to alter it, and beyond court orders. By the time
we have the means to alter the plaque, we will have only interest, not a
desire to change it.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.3 How Long is Forever?</h3>
</p>

<p>
The people who gave us the big bang theory also provided the possibility of
the big crunch, when the universe falls back on itself. The whole process,
bang-to-crunch, a pulse, is projected to take 100 billion years, and we are
about 15 billion years into the pulse that our universe might be (10). This
provides a convenient definition of forever. Just like 'beyond' is part of
'inside' for the curved space-time continuum, 'forever' is part of 'during'
in the space-time continuum. These assumptions give us a fixed size
universe to record, index, to provide information to and to store
information in(10).
</p>

<p>
The big bang-crunch provides a convenient definition. If the crunch does
not happen, then it will take a billion trillion trillion (a decillion) (10
** 33) years for the 100 trillion decillion decillion (10 ** 80) particles
in the universe to decay into energy.(10) This possibility would be
inconvenient. It might be necessary to go back to defining forever as
a-long-time, but a-long-time would be fine for the purposes of this paper.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.4 Engineering Bits to Last Forever</h3>
</p>

<p>
The longevity of individual bits on the plaque can be calculated using
statistical chemistry. The longevity of the information represented by the
bits can be engineered to be of any desired length through the use of error
correcting codes (ECC's)(11). There are already ECC's in wide use(4). For
example, the ECC that raises the raw error rate on CD's from one error in
ten to the fifth power, or one-in-one-hundred-thousand, to one error in ten
to the twelfth power, or one-in-one-trillion. Given easily achievable rates
of bit fading over the life of the universe, any desired level of certainty
of bit survival can be achieved.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.5 Current and Near Term Preservation Technology</h3>
</p>

<p>
Going beyond current CDs, and beyond DVDs, using ion milling(12) with a 50
nanometer spot size, 165 gigabytes can be stored, this year, for a
conservatively projected 1 thousand year life, on a CD sized nickel disk
from Norsam Technologies.(7) The nickel disk is corrosion resistant and is
stable over a wide range of environmental condition.
</p>

<p>
An example of technology available in the near term is an ion milled, 8 to
12 inch iridium disk. The iridium disk uses a 7 nanometer spot size to
store 50 terabytes (50 trillion bytes) for a possible, but not yet
engineered, 100 billion year life. To put this in perspective and to show
what is coming, using future technology, the content of this disk, 50
terabytes, could be sent over a single optical fiber, with the 1300
nanometer optical carrier modulated at one bit per baud, in under two
seconds.(13)
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.6 Is It Economically Feasible to Protect the Bits 
from All Dangers?</h3>
</p>

<p>
The cost of magnetic disk storage has dropped by a factor of about
1-million-to-1 over the last twenty-five years (14). Even easier to
calculate, over the last twenty-five years, the cost of RAM (Random Access
Memory) had dropped from about one US dollar per byte to about one US
dollar per megabyte, also a factor of 1-million-to-1(14). By the time we
can retrieve the Voyager plaque, we will also be able to scatter an
effectively unlimited number of Voyager plaque-equivalents throughout our
universe, for essentially no cost, in a pattern that will make them
irretrievable in their entirety, and thus unalterable, while simultaneously
guaranteeing retrievability for at least one copy.
</p>

<p>
The rate of cost reduction has actually been exceeded by the reduction in
physical size. In 1972, the IBM 2314 magnetic disk system required 10
square meters (120 square feet) of floor space, including access panel
swing and operator walk space, a volume of 25 cubic meters (1 thousand
cubic feet), to store 8 magnetic disk drives with a capacity of 25
megabytes each, or 200 megabytes. Today a 9 gigabyte, half-height, 3 ½ x 1
½ x 5 inch, .5 liter (.015 cubic foot), magnetic disk drive stores 45 times
the information in 1/50,000 times the volume, a reduction of 2-million-to-1
in twenty-five years.
</p>

<p>
In 1972 a megabyte of RAM required 4 square meters (40 square feet) of
floor space or 10 cubic meters (350 cubic feet). In 1998 a chip containing
8 megabytes of RAM requires 2 milliliters (1/8 th cubic inch), a reduction
in volume of 40-million-to-1.
</p>

<p>
These reductions are a million-to-1 in 25 years, a trillion-to-1 in 50
years and a trillion-trillion-(a sextillion)-to-1 in 100 years. And, we
tend to underestimate technological predictions in the long run(15).
</p>

<p>
We are well on our way to Eric Drexler's world of nanotechnology(9), where
the 6.022 x 10 to the 23 rd power (more than a half-trillion-trillion)
atoms in a mole of iridium weigh only 192 grams (4 ounces) (16) and we do
not need many iridium atoms to store a bit forever.
</p>

<p>
Sending information over the internet is free. This is inconceivable, even
today.
</p>

<p>
Historically, information technology has maintained steep price reduction
trends over long periods of time. There is a story that a few centuries ago
England was happy to spend a royal fortune to build a chain of signal
towers from Lands End to London to send the single bit of information that
the Spanish Armada was coming in 1588.
</p>

<p>
As storage declines in price, space limitations disappear as a constraint
for old record formats. For older records this will break the sequence of
weeding out duplicates and then losing the one remaining original through
misfiles, disaster, theft, or accidental destruction.
</p>

<p>
Declining prices and shrinking volume do not solve the problem entirely,
however. New types of documents will continue to need ever increasing
numbers of bits per item. This will maintain the need for professional
judgement to limit accessions to accommodate space constraints.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.7 Can our Civilizations be Recorded as Ones 
and Zeros? Exclusively?</h3>
</p>

<p>
All of this 'promise of technology' assumes that all of our records can be
recorded as ones and zeros, in binary. Until recently this was held in
question by many people. With the advent of CD's for music, DVD's for
movies and video, the use of computers in publishing and the office
environment, digital cameras, and digital fax machines, recording
information as ones and zeros has become synonymous with recording
information.
</p>

<p>
Digital copiers and fax machines render older analog documents into a
digital form on a regular basis. Few people listen to music with the
realization that it is stored as ones and zeros, but everyone readily
accepts the fact when it is presented. Today, the basis for most of our
world is digital, with an analog veneer(17).
</p>

<p>
Modern manufacturing starts with a digital model, which is rendered into
physical form by computer controlled machines (18). Chemistry and genetics
now start with a digital model of elements and bond properties that combine
to form molecules with computer model predicted properties.
</p>

<p>
Not only can existing library, archives, and museum items be digitized,
most new items are now first created in digital form(19). The best image of
a book is the digital file produced by the program used to typeset the
book. Librarians will have to come to terms with the practice of preserving
the degraded paper version of the original digital image.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.8 Can the Perfectly Preserved Bits Be Correctly 
Interpreted?</h3>
</p>

<p>
<h4 align="LEFT">The Need for Emulators</h4>
</p>

<p>
One of the harbingers of the coming digital age is the suspicion that we
may lack the ability to make sense of our recorded ones and zeros in the
future. At first meta-data was hailed as the savior. Then we discovered
that meta-data deals with declarative records and not with procedural
information (20).
</p>

<p>
For procedural information, such as the actual interpretation of a word
processor file by a specific version of a word processor, one needs an
emulator. Further, the emulator must provide for running a specific version
of a specific operating system on specific computer hardware. The output of
the first emulator must then be sent to an emulator running a specific
version of display software, on an emulator of a specific graphics display
card, or a specific version of a page description language (PDL) (e.g.
PostScript Level 3 (21)), running an emulator of a specific version of a
printer.
</p>

<p>
An emulator, which is the key to the puzzle, the digital library conundrum,
is the binary embodiment of a specific configuration of hardware in binary
form that can be preserved along with the meta-data and data. With
emulators, a complete set of support software, meta-data, and the data, the
entire document environment can be recreated from stored bits at any point
in the future.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.9 The Theory of Emulators</h3>
</p>

<p>
Emulators depend on the theoretical computer science concept of a Turing
Machine(22). A Turing Machine is a mechanism that implements the minimum
number of instructions needed to be a stored program computer. Because any
stored program computer can be emulated by a Turing Machine, and because
any computer can emulate a Turing Machine, there is a transitive
relationship that says that any computer can be emulated on any other
computer throughout all time.
</p>

<p>
Initially emulators are implemented in hardware or microcode because these
implementations are much faster. Over time, as hardware continues to become
faster, speed becomes a moot point, and software emulators provide all the
speed required.
</p>

<p>
The goal for emulators is a sealed module that correctly accepts binary
file inputs and provides binary file outputs. Unfortunately emulators are
never perfect, although a very close approximation is available to
archivists. Over time archivists will occasionally discover, and perhaps
correct additional bugs, making the emulators about as perfect as the
various hardware versions of a given computer ever become.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.10 Displaying Digital Records that Lack a 
Display Form</h3>
</p>

<p>
Beyond word processor records, there are many digital records that do not
have an obvious display form. They rely on the execution of a program to
produce a displayable form of the record. These programs can only be
executed on the computers they were designed for. When the computers are no
longer available, the programs cannot be run and the documents can no
longer be displayed.
</p>

<p>
Documents that digitally represent the chemicals, Computer Aided Design
(CAD)(18) files, manufactured items, databases, and Geographic Information
System (GIS)(23) records are even more dependent on emulators for accurate
renditions of digital records into viewable and otherwise useable forms.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.11 Current Emulation in PCs</h3>
</p>

<p>
Because versions of an operating system emulated previous versions of the
same operating system, low fidelity emulation of some operating system
features may change the image of a document from one version of the
operating system to another. All of these elements constitute the
provenance of a digital document.
</p>

<p>
Part of the accession process is identifying these elements and preserving
contemporary print and display bit-map images of the document for future
verification of the correct operation of the provenancial emulator and
software. Automation of this check is easily defined because, in most
cases, the emulator should produce a perfect match for the preserved
contemporary bitmap. (Archivists also have a professional responsibility to
understand that because to the Nyquist sampling theorem(24), a 600 dpi
computer generated bitmap from a PDL is equivalent in quality to a 1200 dpi
raster scanned bitmap.)
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.12 A History of Emulators: IBM</h3>
</p>

<p>
Emulators are another example of finding a solution in history. They are
built into IBM mainframes so they can run all of the legacy applications in
the mainframe world, some of which are over half a century old. IBM wrote
the Report Program Generator (RPG) language to emulate Electronic
Accounting Machine (EAM) equipment from the 1940s and 1950s on the 1401 and
1410 computers of the early 1960s (25). The 1401 and 1410 were then
emulated in microcode on the 360 computers of the late 1960s and 1970s
(14). One of the key benefits of IBM's Multiple Virtual System (MVS)
operating system of the 1970s was that it allowed customers to run multiple
versions of obsolete operating systems in order to support legacy
applications that depended on the obsolete versions of the operating system
on emulators of obsolete computers. These legacy features are themselves
emulated on the IBM 390 computers of the 1990s.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.13 A History of Emulators: Intel</h3>
</p>

<p>
Each of the Intel chip generations emulates(26) all previous generations,
as does Intel's latest Merced chip which uses microcode, a binary
representation of the complex instructions formerly implemented in the
hardware of earlier processors.
</p>

<p>
Software emulators are actually built for all of the most popular
microprocessors, before they are actually produced, so that the operating
systems for the new generation of microprocessors can be written and tested
while the microprocessors are still being developed.
</p>

<p>
Bill Gates' legendary basic program for the Altair was written on a one
hundred percent software emulator of an Intel 8080 microprocessor that ran
on a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP 10 computer.(27)
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.14 A Call for Emulators</h3>
</p>

<p>
Archivists have a responsibility to preserve these emulators in their
archives as part of the provenance of archival materials. The emulators
must be preserved in a form that is useable throughout time (binary).
</p>

<p>
A series of emulator layers, applied sequentially (executed in series) is
part of the digital provenance of records. To avoid migration of emulator
code, when the computer that emulator A is designed to run on becomes
obsolete, the emulator A is run on Emulator B, where emulator B emulates
the computer emulator A was designed to run on. This problem, of requiring
a series of emulators, can be solved in a more general way by writing
emulators to run an emulation of a Turing Machine (or any standard model of
a computer instruction set). Then there would never be more than two layers
of emulation: the first layer would be the original emulator that runs on a
Turning Machine and the second would be a Turing Machine emulator that ran
on a future contemporary computer. The UCSD (University of California at
San Diego) Pascal compiler generates an intermediate P-code that is the
equivalent of the Turing Machine emulator in this case. The P-code makes
the compiler independent of the target machine instruction set. The Java
virtual machine is a more rigorously defined example of a universal
intermediate platform(28).
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.15 Where Emulators May Fail Themselves</h3>
</p>

<p>
Like all systems, there are some aspects of emulation that emulators will
probably not provide. Emulators emulate the instruction set of a computer,
not the microcode instruction set that implements the instructions.
Therefore, bugs in the microcode, such as the one in the early Intel
Pentium processors (33) will not be emulated. It is possible that
archivists may also preserve microcode emulators. This would certainly
begin to show the depth, diversity, and richness of the archival
profession.

<h3 align="LEFT">2.16 Dynamic, Linked Databases Stored in Snapshots</h3>
</p>

<p>
Modern databases are changing. In the past, when new data was entered in a
database field, the data previously in the field was overwritten. Today,
the newer databases provide the option of implementing data fields as
pushdown stacks. In a pushdown stack, the new data is placed on top of the
old data, the old data is pushed down one level, and meta data about the
change is recorded as an attachment to the new data. Meta data can include
the date of the change, the person making the change, and the authorization
for the change. Thus, the database extends back in time.
</p>

<p>
Emulators do not solve the problem of preserving a database that is
effectively infinitely extensile both physically and in time, such as the
internet. Emulators do, however make snapshots a much more viable solution
for a partial, temporary solution to the problem. Emulators handle records
that are published with aplomb. To the extent that these databases can be
published as snapshots, emulators can permanently preserve the dynamic
linked databases while more complete solutions are being developed.
</p>

<p>
By definition, hypertext is dynamic and infinitely extensible(59). That
does not mean that it is not publishable. A snapshot from time to time may
provide a stability that is not otherwise available. Eventually the dynamic
hypertext and permanent preservation may grow together, but that solution
does not seem to be at hand. Perhaps the free and nanoscopic world of
molecular machines will do it(9).
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.17 Short Term Preservation</h3>
</p>

<p>
Preservation within the lifetime of a civilization concentrates on
preserving the digital record, the bits and not the medium the bits are
stored on. This is because the civilization can support copying. Beyond a
civilization, only multiple, very long lived, copies can be used. Within a
civilization, the life of digital media is not important, only the digital
record, the bits, need be preserved. In this case, removing the bits from
the incoming media is part of accessioning the record. An example of this
is the United States National Archives and Records Administration which has
transferred all binary records to a standard magnetic tape format which it
plans to refresh to the latest format about every decade(17). For
trans-civilization preservation, the permanence of the digital media is
synonymous with the preservation of the digital record.
</p>

<p>
In digital copying, a perfect digital record is recreated using additional
redundant information recorded along with the original digital record. This
redundant information is needed to implement an error correcting code
(ECC)(11). The newly corrected, perfect digital copy is then recorded on
new media. Thus in digital archives, the newest, most copied documents are
the most accurate, with the fewest raw bit errors. Conversely, in
traditional archives, the oldest, least copied, documents are the most
accurate.
</p>

<p>
This is not to say that there are not serious short-term problems in
managing digital information. A long term plan may provide some guidance
for short term plans, and long term, permanent storage may insure that
materials are not lost as the short term use of dynamic storage, networks,
and computing platforms makes permanence elusive.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.18 Chain of Custody, Integrity</h3>
</p>

<p>
For shorter-term preservation, a civilization provides the ability to
encrypt a digital seal on the record. An encryption key can only last the
life of a civilization because the integrity of the separation of the
record from the key requires a civilization.
</p>

<p>
In the short term, records can be protected absolutely with digital seals.
A digital seal is something like an error correcting code that has been
encrypted. While the content of the record may be non-encrypted, any change
to the content of the record would be identified as an error when the error
correcting code was decrypted and applied to the record. Records found to
have been altered can be discarded and replaced with unaltered copies of
the original records that have been stored at an alternate location and
that have had their digital seals checked for alteration as well.
</p>

<p>
At the start of each day, an archivist can check the integrity of an entire
archives, using a hierarchy of digital seals, and make certain that not
even a single bit has been lost or changed. By managing access to the
digital seal over time, an archivist can establish and maintain the chain
of custody of items stored in an archives. With the chain of custody, the
integrity of the archives can be assured.
</p>

<p>
Digital seals can also protect records intended to provide
trans-civilization preservation through the use of very long lived media.
This trans-civilization use can be assured by only encrypting the digital
seal and not encrypting the preserved information. More problematical is
the alternative of encrypting the preserved records and assuming that
future advanced civilizations will be able to easily break the encryption
and decrypt the preserved information.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.19 Creating a Vision as a Given and Growing into It</h3>
</p>

<p>
<h4 align="LEFT">Planning as Though the Vision was Going to Happen</h4>
</p>

<p>
Rather than collecting information about technology, we can start with the
vision that everything will be preserved throughout all time. We can start
to plan, build, prepare, making policy decisions and incorporating
technology and accessioning records in accordance with our vision before we
know the exact technology that will be used. Eric Drexler suggests the need
for careful discussion planning well in advance of the availability of
advanced technology(9).
</p>

<p>
While the technology is at hand to preserve materials forever, it is still
true that vision, precedes the creation of the tools to support the vision.
The whole is not the sum of the parts, the whole determines the parts and
comes first. Freedom is not the result of our work, our work is the
expression of our freedom.
</p>

<p>
This is not so very unusual. All planning assumes the success of the plan.
It is when the possibility of the vision is unbelievable that difficulties
arise. The United States Declaration of Independence and Constitution laid
out a framework, a vision, a creation, which the United States is still
growing into.
</p>

<p>
Action is also required. George Santayana the philosopher said "Those who
cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." However, those that
remember the past, but do plan far enough ahead to apply the lessons of the
past to the future, are condemned to relive the mistakes of the past in
their future.
</p>

<p>
A large percentage of what is preserved today will be preserved forever.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">2.20 Summary</h3>
</p>

<p>
Emulators solve many of the problems not solved by storing meta-data and
not solved by migration of digital media. Media is being developed to meet
the needs of archives. The archival media is physically robust, and does
not require periodic copying to compensate for rapid deterioration over
centuries or millennia. Costs are dropping rapidly and storage capacities,
per unit volume, are increasing rapidly. Many archival preservation
problems can be solved by making numerous, low cost, complete copies of
entire digital archives. The promise of permanent preservation is at hand.
We can, and should, begin to plan for it now.
</p>

<p>
<h2 align="CENTER">3. The Act of Creation</h2>
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.1 Introduction</h3>
</p>

<p>
Creation, the act of making something from nothing, is the essence of what
is preserved in libraries, archives, and museums. That which is merely a
transformation, a mechanical copying, is not of interest, except as part of
the provenance of an item.
</p>

<p>
The act of publishing, making something ready to fit to the linked, larger
world is a creative act. Bringing together two creations, an item and the
linked world, to form one creation, makes publishing a creative act.
Preservation is a creative act because it is an extension of publishing.
</p>

<p>
A future researcher's exhuming of a preserved item and linking the item
into their future world is a creative act because it brings together two
creations, the preserved item, and the creation that is their future world,
forming one creation.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.2 The Meaning of Publishing, the Meaning 
of Document</h3>
</p>

<p>
One could say that a published document is a presentation of information in
a form that can be integrated into the sum of recorded information.
Publishing could be said to be the extra effort that is taken to create a
document from stored information.
</p>

<p>
Historically, the effort of publication has been imposed by the limitation
of previous technologies. When the technologies were swept away by
computing, many thought that all the effort in publishing could be
dispensed with. Unfortunately this eliminates the production of published
documents and leaves just raw information. Publishing a document indicates
some level of checking, some level of group agreement and approval, some
promise that it is likely that the document can be correctly interpreted,
and that a good citizen effort has been made to limit the number of targets
to which multiple reference might be made. Raw information caries none of
these traits.
</p>

<p>
In publication, reference targets or versions should be limited in number
to balance the demand for a readers time and understanding between the one
published item at hand and the universe of items the published item has
been linked to. In the case of versions, more is definitely not better.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.3 Did We Get It?</h3>
</p>

<p>
Preserving starts with what is preserved. The connection between the
information, knowledge, and wisdom and the digital record is the person
certifying that the digital record is accurate in both quality and content.
In accessioning a record to a digital system, the original record must be
identified and the fidelity of digitizing process must be certified. Only a
person can do this. For this reason, all digital records must be sealed by
a person operating under the authority of their civilization. At all times
in the conversion and preservation process, the chain of custody of the
record must be secure and the provenance preserved.(4)
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.4 The Archival Basis for Interpretation</h3>
</p>

<p>
Archives are a good model for evaluating all the versions of 'refresh' and
'migration' that digital libraries propose. (Refresh is defined as the
exact copying the bits in a binary file, with the application of an error
correcting code, to new media. Migration is defined as updating preserved
document or record files to be compatible with the current version of the
applications that created the files.) The archivist's responsibility to
preserve the actual original documents can be projected to preserving: the
original data or document files, the original bitmaps of printed and
displayed documents, and the provenance of the software version that
created the files, the operating system version that supported the software
version, the emulator for the computer that the operating system ran on,
and the emulators for the software and hardware used to print and display
the bitmap images of the documents.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.5 Interpretation</h3>
</p>

<p>
Any form of improved access or interpretation, such as migration, is
beneficial, as long as the original documents, in their original form, are
still accessible. Historically, the survival of original documents could
not be guaranteed, due to deterioration, theft, fire, or willful
distraction. This is no longer the case. We can guarantee survival of
original documents through the production and dispersion of multiple
identical, low cost, long lived, digital copies.
</p>

<p>
It is important to remember that all forms of migration are
interpretations: image processing on raster bit maps, raster based OCR
(Optical Character Recognition)(60), raster to vector conversion, 2D
(dimensional) to 3D conversion and 3D to solid model conversion in
engineering drawings, the 16 to 32 bit conversion, the coming 32 to 64 bit
conversion(26), and the Y2K (year two thousand) conversion in software,
auto-refining of catalog databases, and source file version updates for
documents. Each of these forms requires the creative act of proofing,
review, republishing, and in some cases re-engineering.
</p>

<p>
Preserving the original assures that no damage can be done in
interpretation, as happened in the past when the interpretation supplanted
the original. The digital equivalent of replacing the original with a copy
is expending funds on interpretation (digital migration) while original
documents are being lost. During interpretation it is important to remember
that provenance of the document is a fundamental part of the original
document and all interpretations should themselves be linked by their own
provenance to original documents.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.6 An Example of Mechanical Migration Without 
Interpretation</h3>
</p>

<p>
To illustrate the problems of mechanical migration of records, without the
creativity inherent in the professions of librarianship, archival
administration, and museum curatorship, we need merely call on the famous
author who wrote under the pen name of Twelve Feet (Two Fathoms or Mark
Twain without the mechanical migration).
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.7 Interpretation, an Act of Creation</h3>
</p>

<p>
Because interpretation is republishing, which is an act of creation, it
requires the act of a person. If someone does not check and sign the
interpretation, the act of creation is on the part of the person who is the
viewer of the interpretation to judge if usefulness. It is the
responsibility of the archivist to make the person using an archives aware
of the provenance of what is being viewed. If the item being viewed is an
interpretation, the provenance of the interpretation must be made available
and explained.
</p>

<p>
An example of interpretation is OCR. The popular program, Adobe Acrobat
(34) interprets a bitmap image of a document and replaces it with the
raster registered vector based character glyphs that most exactly match the
scanned bitmap characters, their font and their size. Here the few glyphs
that are not recognized are left as in the original raster scanned form.
This process produces beautiful, typeset quality documents because the few
glyphs that are left in their original raster form are invisible. The
raster glyphs are invisible because the eye fixes on the overall quality of
the vector glyph typeset document and effectively averages out the ragged
edges of the few raster scanned glyphs.
</p>

<p>
Patrons assume that typeset quality documents have been through a
publishing process in which errors were removed. With the replace bitmap
form of Acrobat, this assumption is not correct. In fact, because a
dictionary is included in the OCR process, words can be changed to better
match the OCR model of the document, with the result disguised as
beautifully typeset text. In this case, archivists also have a special
responsibility to understand the mechanisms of vision and perception(29).
</p>

<p>
Archivists' professional responsibility extends to accommodating
disabilities. When necessary, the provenance of a displayed image should
include a transformation of color spaces to match the color gamut
available to color blind patrons(29). That is, archivists must make
available systems that produce individualized color shifts for each
colorblind patron so that each person can see images with the best fidelity
available.
</p>

<p>
Archivists also have a professional responsibility to know about the
Acrobat option to preserve the original bitmap and to use the OCR text
output exclusively as a finding aid.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.8 Paradigms</h3>
</p>

<p>
A paradigm is an act of creation. In creation, from nothing comes
everything. Paradigms, like our universe, are all encompassing. In our
universe, 'beyond' exists only 'inside' our curved space-time and 'after'
exists only 'during'. Because a paradigm is all encompassing, within a
paradigm, there is no outside, and no beyond. The paradigm of technology
admits to no other paradigm. Within a paradigm, the paradigm is invisible,
like good typography. Things in the paradigm 'are', as in 'are reality'.
Things outside the paradigm 'are not', as in non-existent.
</p>

<p>
Speaking to someone in another paradigm is difficult, if not impossible.
Words do not have the same meaning. Obvious, essential basic concepts have
no meaning or are attacked. The complete lack of common ground brings
mistrust. Seeing something from the other person's point of view means
giving up everything you believe in. You may learn how to predict the other
person's actions, but you can never relate to them.
</p>

<p>
We can conceive of more than one paradigm, we may be able to stand in more
than one paradigm, but beyond that, it is extremely difficult to operate or
reason in more than one paradigm without shrinking our multiple paradigms
back to a single paradigm.
</p>

<p>
Because all paradigms include, and are created complete with, their own
history, once we have personally entered a paradigm, we also discover that
there has always been a history of the paradigm that showed that there were
good reasons for the paradigm's existence. For example, when we see that
emulators are useful in preservation, we enter the paradigm of emulators.
Being in the emulator paradigm, we can see that there is a history of
emulators that makes it obvious that emulators are the best choice for
permanent preservation. Outside of the emulator paradigm, it is not at all
obvious that emulators are in any way useful for permanent preservation.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.9 Interpreting, Creating a Paradigm</h3>
</p>

<p>
One does not truly enter a national park until they have created a context
for the park in their paradigm. Because Horace Albright realized this, he
wrote the first instructions for national park rangers to interpret
national parks for visitors. The interpretation is intended to assist park
visitors in creating their own context for a park(30).
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.10 Will the Information Be Interpretable 
Across Civilizations?</h3>
</p>

<h4 align="left">What is the Meaning of Meaning?</h4>

<p>
There are many answers to this question.
</p>

<p>
Given the ability to guarantee the reproduction of bits until the end of
the universe, there is still the issue of meaning. The concept of the
sociology of knowledge(31) says that information and knowledge is specific
to a civilization and that meaning dies with a civilization.
</p>

<p>
The most extensively funded work on long term (over ten thousand years)
information preservation has focused on preserving civilization along with
the recorded information. Monasteries have been proposed to maintain the
interpretation of keep-out signs on nuclear waste dumps.(35)
</p>

<p>
In the face of this possible need to preserve our civilization in order to
preserve our records, we can assume that future interpreters will be able
to reconstruct our civilization as we have reconstructed past civilizations
lost to us. To assist future interpreters, we can include what we hope is a
Rosetta Stone (36) with our preserved information. This is what was done
with the Voyager spacecraft plaque.(3)
</p>

<p>
We have many examples of interpreting lost civilizations. Egyptian and
Mayan temple carvings(32), separated from us by millennia, can be
interpreted in many ways, none of which are certain. But, we are much
closer to these civilizations than the future interpreters will be in a
billion, or even a million years.
</p>

<p>
However, in some cases, contemporary events are difficult to interpret for
contemporary observers. Even in our personal lives, we are out of sync with
the times of our surroundings. This suggests great problems when a decade,
much less a century or millenium separates the creation of a digital record
from its interpretation. Today, the six million transistors of a Pentium II
micro-processor cycle 300 million times per second, executing about 300
million instructions per second to do our word processing(26). This fact is
beyond interpretation in most of our personal contexts.
</p>

<p>
An alternative to the need for future interpreters to reconstruct our lost
civilization is to assume that in preserving the record of our civilization
forever, we may cause our civilization to last forever. This possibility is
outlined in the last section of this paper.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.11 First People, Then Technology</h3>
</p>

<p>
We can, and have, engineered bits to last forever. This prospect of bits
that will last until the end of time has nothing to do with our ability to
know, to learn, to create, or to be wise. All that we speak of, all that we
record, the essence of our civilization, is outside our recording
mechanism, which is a part of our engineering. It is possible that we will
never know how we know, learn, create, or act wisely.
</p>

<p>
The ability to describe, understand, and engineer our technology must be
dealt with, lived with, 'groked' (37), simultaneously with the realization
that the essence of creating the material we are preserving is outside of
the paradigm of technology and possibly outside our ability to describe or
understand. Creating may be something we are only able to do, not something
we can describe or understand. For this reason, technology must always play
a secondary role to the creation we wish to embody in our preserved records
and our preserved documents.
</p>

<p>
It would be better to lose everything we have recorded, and all of our
technology, than to suffer even the slightest diminution in our ability to
create.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.12 Moving Up the Scale</h3>
</p>

<p>
Discernable differences (e.g. pits in the smooth surface of a CD) can be
used to represent bits. No machine can make a discernable difference into a
bit, only a person can declare that a discernable difference is a bit. No
matter how many discernable differences are seen in the record of our
civilization that might be preserved forever, only an interpreter can see
them as bits to be interpreted.
</p>

<p>
There is no number of bits, large or small, that can make the bits into
data. The beginning and end of a data element or measurement must be
defined by a person. And, the data representing elements or measurements
must be assigned meaning by a person.
</p>

<p>
Moving from data to information again requires interpretation, creation of
meaning. A person must create an idea in which the data can be understood
as information.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge could be said to be an analog of reality. Knowledge can only be
created by a person. No amount of information can produce knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Wisdom caries with it the concept of 'should' or morality. Knowledge does
not produce wisdom. Only a person is able to become wise. Only a person can
assist another person in becoming wise.
</p>

<p>
When we record information forever, we are hoping that our permanent
discernable differences will foster wisdom forever. We have no proof that
it will happen, or even if it is possible. We many not be able to know if
it is possible, but is a noble cause.
</p>

<p>
Lord Kelvin said that (paraphrased) : "If it cannot be measured, it is
unimportant(38)." A possible corollary, with respect to moving up each step
on this scale is "If it can be measured, it is unimportant." The ability to
move up from step to step, an action on which our digital records rely for
usefulness, is immeasurable, perhaps unknowable. It is, however, something
we can do, and something it is possible that future interpreters may be
able to do as well.
</p>

<p>
We know we can preserve the bits. We must guess that we, or some other
interpreters, will be able to make use of them.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.13 Technologists Create</h3>
</p>

<p>
We must dispense with the technologist's question: "How can you say you
created it from nothing if so much existed before you created it?" To
exist, every bit requires an act of creation by a person. This is true even
though the discernable difference existed before the bit was created.
</p>

<p>
Technologists also live in this gap. All digital records and signals are
analog in nature, by definition. The finest digital distinctions, found in
quantum mechanics, are probabilistically not really there (39). All of our
records preserved as bits are digital analogs of the documents they
preserve, a seeming contradiction in terms, even an oxymoron. We therefore
use analog digital signals and media to preserve the digital analogs of our
documents.
</p>

<p>
Using logic, it is possible to say that it is logical to say that it is not
logical to be logical. That is, to paraphrase Goedel, you can't prove
things about a system from within the system (40). There are many aspects
of ourselves that are not amenable to being figured out, among them is the
basis (creation) for things we seek to preserve forever in binary form.
</p>

<p>
Beyond analog and digital, what is preserved in a bit is a pure
mathematical concept, a one or a zero, not a physical embodiment.
Collectively, with error correcting codes, the mathematical concept of bits
can last until the end of the universe when it will not be possible to
distinguish a one from a zero.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing wrong with good engineering. The Library of Congress
building was completed ahead of schedule, under budget by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers in 1898 and is an incredible work of art (41). It
is merely helpful to see it as an act of creation.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.14 Creation in a Moment of Insight</h3>
</p>

<p>
In the same way that our universe suddenly was, with no 'before' before the
big bang, creations spring forth instantly, with no past, created from
nothing.
</p>

<p>
An archives is not a room full of records, it is an idea, a commitment, an
agreement, a creation. An archives is created in the instant a person with
the authority says: "We will have an archives. Lock the records room. Write
procedures. Restrict and manage access." An archives ends in an instant as
well, when a person with the authority says: "We do not need an archives.
Unlock the records room. Throw away the procedures. Let anyone who needs
the records have them."
</p>

<p>
Archivists are devoted to continuity. Archivists and their archives
represent their parent organizations' devotion to continuity. Continuity is
very helpful, very important. Continuity and creation are a strange
combination, but archivists must create and support creation on the part of
others and on the part of the archives parent organization.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.15 Seven at a Time: And Other Limitations</h3>
</p>

<p>
One of the limitations we seem to have as people is that we can only hold
or consider no more than about seven concepts at the same time. For this
reason when we catalog, outline, or organize our writings, objects, or any
of our creations, with more than seven divisions in one category, we group
some of the items to form a sub category. (This section of this paper,
Section 3, has an informal subgroup of subsection that have the word
'create' in their title.) That is why there are seven layers in the ISO OSI
(International Standards Organization Open System Interconnect) protocol
stack. That is also the source of management's span of control tending
toward seven people working for one person, and forming formal or informal
subgroups if there more than seven people working for one person. The best
description of this limitation is in a paper entitled the "Magical Number
Seven Plus or Minus Two published in 1956.(42)".
</p>

<p>
The limit on the number of concepts we can hold simultaneously is linked to
the functioning of our short term memory(42). It is also linked to our
vision(29). We merge image that are presented to us at more than about 60
per second. This produces the illusion of motion. (43) Conversely, we can
perceive individual images present at less than 60 image per second. This
is used in the craft of book design (44) to make it possible to flip
through the pages of a book at 60 pages per second. This can be seen easily
by observing how many pages are flipped to find a given page in a book and
then reflecting on the number of seconds the flipping required. The most
common example of this is in using a dictionary.
</p>

<p>
The downside of the speed with which we can perceive images is that if we
do not get stimulus to hold our attention on a topic, our short term memory
will fade or be replace in under one second. More than one second will then
be required to refresh our short term memory, to recontextualize our
actions. For tasks such as word processing, database interaction, and most
recently and most importantly internet access, a task that requires a
fraction of a second to complete will have its execution time extended by
more than a second if the system does not provide the user with a response
in a fraction of a second. Addressing this perceptual parameter can
increase by a factor of one, two, or more(45).
</p>

<p>
Librarians, Archivist, Museum Curators, and Records Managers have a
professional responsibility to be aware of these limitations when designing
access mechanisms. These limitations are also some of the differences we
may have with future intelligences, who might receive our preserved record.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">3.16 Summary</h3>
</p>

<p>
The concept of creation is essential to preservation. Without it, one may
come to believe that copying is preservation and that future reproduction
is the goal of preservation.
</p>

<p>
Most of what is needed in preservation constitutes creative acts.
Preservation and preservation systems are domains of creative people.
</p>

<p>
What is preserved is not conveyed to the future until an interpreter
recreates the item or concept, the creation, for themselves.
</p>

<p>
We do not understand creation. We do not know if our attempts in support of
future creation will succeed. But, if success is not certain, neither is
failure. We can try.
</p>

<p>
<h2 align="CENTER">4. The Effect of Our Effort</h2>
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.1 Introduction</h3>
</p>

<p>
Heisenberg said that to measure something is to change it (5). When we
preserve and catalog the record of our civilization, we change our
civilization. We increase understanding and reduce the diversity of our
civilizations. Diversity moves from unawareness to known differences. As we
share in the celebration of our differences, we become more alike. As we
remember better who we have been, who we have been is more a part of our
future.
</p>

<p>
In the face of this, creation is independent of all that exists. That is
why creation is said to be an act of producing from nothing. Leaving the
world of mechanistic logic, we have the possibility of drawing on our
preserved record, or not drawing on our preserved record, as we create our
future. Future users are similarly free to use or not use our preserved
record to create their futures.
</p>

<p>
In addition to changing our own civilization by accessioning our record
into the fully linked structure of the future, we will add to our
civilization's knowledge of our universe.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.2 How Will Preserving Our Record Change Us</h3>
</p>

<p>
To measure something is to change it, an axiom described by Heisenberg (5).
Certainly to record something is to change it, even if the record is
inaccurate or completely fictitious. In Southern California, where the
record of what is built is fictitious, existing only in the popular media
of entertainment and advertising, buildings are built to look the way they
are supposed to in the movies or real estate brochures. Building designs
are influenced by fictional descriptions both to be appealing and to earn
income as on-location movie sets. An example of this is the seaside
Hyperion waste treatment plant on the south side the Los Angeles
International Airport which is built to resemble something out of a space
opera (46).
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.3 Merging Civilizations</h3>
</p>

<p>
Creating a perfectly preserved record of our civilization may, in turn,
preserve our civilization in the same way that it is suggested that the
English language has changed very slowly since the time of Shakespeare(47)
because his writings were so wondrous that no one wanted to give up the
ability to understand his writings in their daily language. Shakespeare's
arrival appears as a seminal event. English had changed more in the century
from the Middle English of Chaucer to the Early Modern English of
Shakespeare than it has in the five centuries since then.
</p>

<p>
The philosophy of Confucius is said to have been the underpinnings of the
Chinese civil service system and the Chinese civil service tests, which
slowed the change of Chinese civilization for two and one half millennia.
The last of Confucius' descendents, Kong Decheng of the 77 th generation,
moved out of the family home, where Confucius had lived in 479 BC, in 1940
AD(48).
</p>

<p>
As with Shakespeare, whose version of English has absorbed all future
changes rather than being deposed or Balkanized by them, recorded
information will tend towards creating one civilization where there were
many. Today, television announcer English captures the mechanism of
homogenization and hegemony in the term. Narrowing the gulf of
interpretation, understanding, and communication between civilizations
reduces the separateness between them, creating a single civilization. It
is difficult to describe the merging of paradigms because by definition
paradigms are fully self contained.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.4 The Future, A Context</h3>
</p>

<p>
Our information can be cataloged by referencing it to a fixed framework of
a known size. In our case, we are 15 billion years into the 100 Billion
year lifetime of our universe(10). In physical dimension, our universe is a
sphere with a radius of 15 billion light years that is expanding at the
speed of light. Libraries, archives, and museums seek to preserve or
provide a group memory for humankind, to provide a context for our thoughts
and activities. Cosmologists define their domain as all of space and time.
We can create syndetic structure to hold and organize our records of what
is known of space and time and our thoughts and activities therein.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.5 Linear Measure</h3>
</p>

<p>
For linear measure the following units provide different contexts or
paradigms that are not easily related to one-another: angstroms, microns,
points, inches, cubits, yards, meters, fathoms, chains, furlongs, li,
miles, leagues, astronomical units, light years, and parsecs. The metric
system brings the possibility of seeing all distances as being related, a
new step in knowing our universe. Distance and time become dimensions along
which information can be organized. We can see that a rainbow is an octave
when the rainbow and octaves are cataloged by the linear dimension of
wavelength.
</p>

<p>
We can see our place in the universe by locating ourselves on our planet
and following our planet through time and space in a three dimensional
astronomical catalog. The movie and book "Powers of Ten"(49) shows the
relationship of size along a scale from atomic particles to the entire
universe.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.6 Time</h3>
</p>

<p>
We do not often see time as merely another dimension. Our calendar is taken
as reality. We begin to see that our calendar is merely a cataloging tool
when we learn that the Catholic Church was off by six years when our
calendar was established, that Jesus Christ was born in 6 BC (a
contradiction in terms), and that the third millennium started in 1994(50).
</p>

<p>
The Jewish calendar(51), which makes 1994 the year 5755, brings order to a
longer period but has been in common usage a few hundred years less than
the Catholic calendar. Events during the earlier periods covered of the
Jewish calendar are even less certain because time as a numeric dimension
convenient for cataloging is a relatively recent invention.
</p>

<p>
Many of the event series and time relationships in the past, that we relate
to easily, would have been recorded quite differently if every action was
timestamped and recorded exactly and forever, as it could be in the future.
Will the future be different if everyone counts microseconds, as they do
when using their PCs, and ignores the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, and the
stars, thusly relegating them to the status of cataloged items?
</p>

<p>
Arthur C. Clark combined the calendar and a three dimensional model in his
'simulacrum' to catalog and display changes in the history of a city in
1956(52). Visitors could use a 4D projection of a simulacrum of the city to
move a cursor through the city in any direction or through time. Any scale
or perspective could be selected, and by moving smoothly one could fly
over, move through, and watch the growth and decline of parts of the city
over time. Hypertext will allow us to catalog using an effectively infinite
number of dimensions. Every object, every item, will have the possibility
of a location in time. How well cataloged should the future be?
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.7 GIS</h3>
</p>

<p>
Cartography has become the production of Geographic Information System
(GIS) databases(23). In GIS databases map features are made up of digital
points and vectors on a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). In a GIS, the image of
the land 's surface can be draped over the DTM using digital
orthophotogrammetry(53). The cameras used in this process are flown in a
plane and us the GPS (Global Positioning Satellite)(54) information to
record very exact digital position, the camera's exposure, camera angle,
and time, and the photograph which can also be recorded digitally. These
features are spreading to all types of digital cameras and spoken
annotations can be added easily in digital form. Soon no photograph will be
without comprehensive digital annotations.
</p>

<p>
In southern California surveys are done often because the land frequently
stretches, slides, thrusts, subsides, accretes, compresses, liquefies,
shrinks, tears, rotates, drifts, expands, bounces, and washes away. There
is no fixed property size, elevation, or location, only a property
configuration on a given day. Some subdivisions, such as Portuguese Bend,
are built on permanent landslides. Older technologies could not keep up.
Now GIS is an important component of emergency planning and response.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.8 CAD (Computer Aided Design)</h3>
</p>

<p>
CAD(18) links the common components of everything manufactured and all
structures built. In combination with GIS(23), we can locate structures in
space. We will be able to find the plans for our house by locating our
house on a map. This will support increased detail in zoning regulations
and increase compliance through access to rules, regulations, and a history
of variances granted. With CAD and GIS, we can see where things are and we
can discuss where we would like new things to be. Building shadows and tree
growth can be modeled and debated.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.9 Chemistry to Nanotechnology</h3>
</p>

<p>
Reactions, molecular structures, and physical properties are modeled in the
computers and then rendered by arranging atoms. The merging of
manufacturing and molecular construction has been mathematically modeled by
Eric Drexler in his Molecular Machines(9). In Eric's world of free
everything, only our thoughts and records will have any value.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.10 Phylogenetics and Genealogy</h3>
</p>

<p>
Eventually all individuals and species will be linked in phylogenetics(55),
with differences shown as a sequence of mutations in the genetic code. The
human genome project(56) will make it possible to link mutations and
genealogy.(57)
</p>

<p>
Phylogenetics will grow up with genealogy and in the fully linked future
world it will seem normal that someone with the name Kung would know they
are a 74 th generation descendent of Confucius(39).
</p>

<p>
Today, seed banks preserve the biodiversity of many species to protect
against the dangers of monoculture(58). Phylogenetics can completely
defines biodiversity. In many cases biodiversity will be defined down to
the individual.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.11 The Foundation for Hypertext(59)</h3>
</p>

<p>
In addition to explicit document links, hypertext will be founded on the
physical syndetic structures of space and time found in CAD, GIS, and 3D
models of the universe, and the chemical structures of nanotechnology and
phylogenetics. Every means of organization will become a dimension of
hypertext. The current possibility of recorded-but-misfiled-and-lost will
essentially disappear.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.12 Hypertext in Support of Document Creation</h3>
</p>

<p>
Hypertext will also reduce the amount of information stored. Today we store
a complete copy of a file every time we make a back-up. Hypertext treats
every keystroke and mouse click as a linkable object. Commands are just
objects made up of keystrokes and mouse clicks. These objects are collected
in a string as a person records information. Hypertext is an efficient
means of using any part of this string to create a new object called a
document. Every keystroke creates a new version, with publication at the
discretion of the author.
</p>

<p>
In hypertext, a delete command is just another object that creates a new
form of a document. Similarly, an un-delete command is just another object
to be added to the string of stored objects. While this makes it impossible
to make an unrecoverable mistake, it also makes it impossible to delete
anything. The actual function of a word processor or a hypertext system is
an implementation decision. In many contexts it is also a matter of rules
and regulations.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.13 Hypertext Links</h3>
</p>

<p>
Adding links to the hypertext database will become synonymous with
research, taking notes, with the simple act of viewing or reading. The act
of choosing something to view or read is an act of creation and can be
saved in a log of reading history. Nothing need be lost. It is the
archivists' professional responsibility to encourage debate on what should
be lost and what should be saved. Hypertext is designed so that all notes,
all viewing and reading histories for all individuals can be made part of
the hypertext database without getting in the way. Adding links will be a
way of life. Those research notes and document drafts that were previously
lost, thrown away, or filed and later discarded, or accessioned into an
archives, will become permanently available links. Even the least formal
links will be used because almost any lead is of value when starting from
scratch on a research topic. Information will, by definition, be fully
hyperlinked, unless we decide not to.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.14 Hypertext Provenance</h3>
</p>

<p>
The original scanned document image should be held inviolate, with all
enhancements and modifications maintained as a series of algorithmic
appliques.
</p>

<p>
Whenever historic artifacts or documents are accessioned, preparation
almost always includes a strong desire to complete the documentation of the
record, or rearrange the material in order to return the documents to their
original order so as to assist the researcher. How often do photographs
contain dates, let alone a summary of the event in which it was taken?
Digital archives provides the first opportunity to both preserve the item
exactly as it was received, while allowing the researcher to apply any
number of interpretive aids without modifying the original.
</p>

<p>
Because a raster digital image has no intrinsic scale, both the original
physical size and the intended viewing size and distance must be explicitly
recorded for preservation as part of the provenance of the image. This is
because a pixel can cover part of an atom, or an entire galaxy, depending
on the subject of a digital image. Billboards are intended to be viewed
from a distance, and stereopticons from the end of one's nose. A digital
image should make note of this meta-data.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.15 Applying Traditional Archival Techniques to 
Digital Imaging</h3>
</p>

<p>
When scanning multiple images on a single piece of film, the entire
microform should be scanned as a single image. Individual images on the
microform can be identified by added digital tags, hyperlinks. Separation
of images on the microform should be logical, not physical.
</p>

<p>
This is the digital equivalence of preserving provenance. If a film is
scanned section by section, there is a chance that some portion will be
missed. More importantly, the relative position of scanned segments are
hard to document. By scanning the film in one piece, provenance is
preserved as part of the scan, just as it is incorporated during the
arrangement of paper records, because of the importance of maintaining the
integrity of the order of the film (paper) document.
</p>

<p>
Scanning the microform as one image also automatically picks up the
resolution test chart(60) at the start and end of microfilm rolls and any
identifying strips or tags filmed along with the documents. The microform
meta data which was developed over a period of a century is seamlessly and
transparently transferred to the digital world, preserving the provenance
of the microform record.
</p>

<p>
By treating each microform as a single image, the policy of refreshing is
favored over the more expensive policy of migration of the images on the
microform, and scarce cataloging funds can be conserved. All of the film
based finding aids will continue to work on the new digital analog of the
film record. No new indexing, beyond indexing the single new digital image,
is required. Additional indexing can be done in hypertext, over the
internet, at any time, by anybody, to any pixel or group of pixels
(sub-image) on the scanned image of the microform. If, in the future,
funding becomes abundant, detailed, sub-image by sub-image (frame by frame
on fiche and roll film), indexing can be done.
</p>

<p>
Scanning microforms as one image is more passive, less expensive, preserves
provenance, and reduces the archivist's role in republishing (migration).
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.16 Beyond Links: Searches</h3>
</p>

<p>
One example of a search technique is a simulated neural network, the same
method we use when we look at something and review everything we have ever
seen to figure out what to do. For us, one result might be: "Yes, that is
my toothbrush." When applied to a comprehensive collection of the OCR
produced text of all documents in a fonds, this search could be used to
discover plagiarism of scripts by comparing every new script to every
script every submitted or registered with the Screen Writer's Guild. It
could also be used to make hyperlinks from newspaper clipping books to the
original papers, reconnecting the theme of the scrapbook to the other
events of the time.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.17 Statements to the Universe</h3>
</p>

<p>
To spread the recognition of their creativity, we can provide every person,
every family, every group, every group of groups with the opportunity to
publish a document from time to time. This document would be their
statement to the universe for all time. This could be a way to apply ISO
9000(61) to the quality of life.
</p>

<p>
Because these personal statements are the very things that are most likely
to be lost over time, it may be that most people benefit from being able to
forget what they say and write in their youth or in moments of stress or
confusion. In our rush to preserve permanently, we need to create tools and
mechanisms to provide the benefits (for example, the ability to loose
records) of the systems that existed in the past, while also providing the
benefits of the new systems we might be proposing.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.18 Should We Do It?</h3>
</p>

<p>
Not long ago we were always within ten minutes of destroying our planet.
This brinkspersonship lasted almost one-half century and was made possible
by a technological advance. Soon we will be able to preserve a record of
our civilization forever, with no possibility of it being lost. The
converse is that we will never be able to destroy the record, and the
record will include everything: how you drove to work each day of your
career, everything you bought, what you read, what you wrote, and what you
erased. And not just for you, for everyone. What should we forget as
individuals? What should we forget as a civilization? Perhaps nothing, but
the question can never be dismissed.
</p>

<p>
In the book 1984, people watched the video from cameras above street
corners. In the real future, we only check the recorded video when an event
occurs. We check the video to see what lead up to the event, what happened
during the event, and what occurred after the event (usually a robbery).
Eventually it could be possible to review someone's entire life on video as
soon as the person does something of interest(60).
</p>

<p>
What correlations will be possible when every tax deduction requires a
traceable transaction number identifying the payer and payee? Archivists
have avoided this problem by saying that it relates to business records and
not to archival quality records. Business records also carry with them a
professional responsibility for judgement. Records managers(61), who turn
their records over to archivists as one of the alternatives when a record
reaches the end of the record's retention schedule, share in the
professional responsibility of librarians, archivists, and museum curators
to preserve the records of our civilization with judgement.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.19 The Existence of a Permanent Preservation 
Plan Will Sustain the Program</h3>
</p>

<p>
No matter what problems exist today with preserving information forever, it
will soon be possible. A permanent preservation plan establishes a goal, a
matrix, a set of expectations, and a place to link ideas for review and
addition. Even if permanent preservation is not immediately available, a
plan says that it is reasonable to assume it will exist in the near future.
If it is said to be likely to exist in the near future, then it is also
likely that we will begin planning for it.
</p>

<p>
What will it look like to us when we are done? This question, created by a
plan, will lead to designs and to growth in every dimension.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.20 A Reward</h3>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one of the benefits of being able to record, and have access to,
all information is that we will see that we are more than that, more than
all the information that it is possible to store. We may see that more
information does not solve our fundamental problems and does not deal with
the fundamental issues of civilization. It may deliver the insight that it
does not mean anything. We will still have to create our civilization,
moment by moment.
</p>

<p>
In the paradigm of creation, the world could end tomorrow. It is only our
current scientific context that says that the world was not created a
moment ago along with all the existing scientific history of our world's
existence.
</p>

<p>
To survive, maybe we will have to evolve, change, forget our civilization
and start an entirely new one.
</p>

<p>
<h3 align="LEFT">4.21 Summary</h3>
</p>

<p>
When we show an order and structure in our catalog for what we have stored
(not 'the' order, 'an' order), we create the possibility of order, of a
fitting together, of all-encompassing, of understanding. We have been able
to do all these things before, just not so perfectly and pervasively. We
have a professional responsibility to everyone affected by our possible
future success.
</p>

<p>
We may also cause our civilization to persist as the record resists change.
A new civilization can no longer be created without the knowledge of
previous civilizations because the record of the previous civilization is
continuously at hand.
</p>

<p>
Two civilizations that are intimately linked in a common record must grow
together, forming a composite civilization. They must follow the path of
two paradigms that move from co-existence to common understanding.
</p>

<p>
Preservation may slow the evolution of civilization and reduces diversity
between coexisting civilizations. This may be good or it may be bad, but it
could be the effect. The effect will probably become stronger as the
preservation becomes more comprehensive, and more permanent, and more
available.
</p>

<p>
<h2 align="CENTER">Conclusion</h2>
</p>

<p>
Preserving everything forever will be technologically feasible in the near
term. Emulators stored as bits will make traditional static preservation
feasible in the permanent digital context. It is reasonable to begin
planning as though preserving everything forever is possible today.
Planning for permanent preservation will provide insights in solving short
term problems. It will also preserve materials that might otherwise be lost
when funds are expended on procedural matters to the exclusion of simple
static preservation.
</p>

<p>
Our planning should be founded on the professions of librarianship,
archival administration, and museum curatorship. We must see our efforts in
the context of creativity, the creativity embodied in what is preserved,
the creativity of preservation, and the creativity inherent in the use of
preserved records. Our preservation efforts are not merely the solution to
a technical problem. We must know, and make it known, that preservation is
not merely copying, not a mechanical task. We have the professional
responsibility to use the newly available technology wisely, in service to
our society, to our civilization, and to future recipients of our preserved
record.

<h3 align="LEFT">Passing the Baton Over the Wall, The Electron Story</h3>
</p>

<p>
Imagine you are a scientist in a billion year old civilization at the end
of the last big bang - big crunch cycle of the universe. You know you
cannot stop the cycle, but you want to pass your archives on to
civilizations in the next cycle. You also know that an electron can be
described as a particle or as a wave. As a wave it can be modulated like a
radio wave, except it has a much higher frequency, and therefore a much
higher information carrying capacity. You use your science to change the
big bang ever so slightly, so that when electrons are created in the next
pulse, the next universe, they are defined as being waves that are
modulated with the information from the archives of your civilization. To
se if this happened, all we have to do is demodulate the information, if
any, from any electron(63).
</p>

<p>
This short story acknowledges the oral tradition as an important way to
preserve information and understand our world. This oral tradition was one
of the earliest examples of the need to refresh files (64). The Bishop
Paiute Tribe has not yet made the transition to a written form for their
language. Their language may go directly from an oral tradition to the
internet and permanent preservation until the end of time. Some of the
discussion of the oral tradition was done with the Cynthia Andrade of the
Bishop Paiute Tribe Telework Center that can be found on the web at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010716003132/http://www.paiute.com/">http://www.Paiute.com</a> and with 
Dolly Manuelito of the Bishop Paiute Even Start
program. One of the aspects of the American Indian oral tradition is that
all actions are taken in the context of their effect on the next seven
generations.

P21. Appraisal: Archives cannot save all information objects; they must
appraise and select for retention the most valuable items. Selection
processes for archives of all kinds -- paper and digital -- are matters of
intellectual judgment about what to include and save and what to exclude.
Criteria for such judgments are largely tied to the intrinsic qualities of
the material and many of the criteria that have proven useful in the paper
world will no doubt translate to and prove equally effective in the digital
environment.

an information object, digital archives must preserve a record of its
origin and chain of custody.

9. Nanotechnology: p 159: Where indefinitely prolonged system life is

13. Speed of document transmission on future fiber optic links. A 1300
nanometer wave length is about a 230 terahertz carrier frequency. In most
cases, the speed of transmission of documents in binary form on fiber optic
links can be increased by replacing the transmitter and receiver and
retaining the fiber that has been previously installed.
</p>

<p>
14. Increase in data density over time: In 1994, IBM said that: IBM’s
magnetoresistive head technology, which underlies magnetic disk design and
prices, had been increasing the areal bit density of magnetic disks at a
rate of 60 percent per year since 1989. IBM projected that the 60 percent
rate would continue for the foreseeable future. IBM’s laboratory results
confirmed this rate until at least the year 2000: The Era of
Magnetoresistive Heads Grochowski, Ed, IBM Research Division, Almaden
Research Center, San Jose, CA., 1994.
</p>

<p>
IBM recently said that it will be able to continue its increase in disk
density of 60 percent per year that it began in 1989: IBM press release,
New Technology Stores 11.6 Billion bits of Data on One Square Inch of Disk,
December 30, 1997, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010716003132/http://www.ibm.com/">http://www.IBM.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
The calculation of the historic rate of decline in magnetic disk storage
cost is based on the price of the 5 MegaByte RAMAC disk drive introduced by
IBM in June, 1957, at a monthly rental of $3,200.00*(in 1957 dollars), and
on 1994 disk prices. The decline from the 1957 RAMAC cost of $100,000 per
MegaByte (Adjusted to 1994 dollars, and adjusted for IBM’s historic desire
to rent rather than sell), to the cost of $ 1 per MByte for drives
available in 1994, represents a decline of 27 percent per year for 37
years: Bashe, Charles J., IBM’s Early Computers, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press,
1986.

15. Technology Forecasting: When viewing these figures, its is important to
remember that projections of technology beyond ten years tend to be
conservative because they do not adequately account for new technology. H.
A. Linstone and M. Turoff, eds., Delphic Method: Techniques and Application
(Addison Wesley: [where], 1975). Also see J. P. Martin, Technological
Forecasting for Decision Making (New York: American Elsevier, 1972).
</p>

<p>
16. Physical and chemical basis for future data storage densities: By
definition, one Mole of molecules is Avogadro's number, 6.022 * 10 ** 23,
of molecules and the weight of 1 mole, in grams, is equal to the atomic
weight of the molecule.
</p>

<p>
17. (A) The present day world has become very digital. (B) NARA, the United
States National Archives and Records Administration) policy for digital
record preservation is to immediately copy all incoming digital records to
a standard form of magnetic tape. The digital records on the standard
digital tape are copied to the new NARA standard for digital storage media
about every ten years.
</p>

<p>
From Charles Dollar: (A) Future historians are likely to view the last
three decades of the twentieth century as a watershed where the convergence
of digital technologies reshaped the information landscape and thereby
fundamentally altered how people create, retrieve, use, and view
information. This convergence is particularly evident in the
telecommunication industries where audio, traditional print, still
pictures, motion pictures, and telephone signals increasingly are being
stored and retrieved in a common digital base. The traditional distinction
between information objects such as letters, books, audio recordings, maps,
photographs, movies, video, and telephony based upon the means of
transmission or carrier of the information that has supported separate
technologies, disciplines, professions, and industries is being eroded. The
magnitude of this transformation and its long-term implications for society
are barely recognized, much less understood, although many contemporary
observers believe that the transformation is similar to what happened with
the introduction of writing three millennia ago.
</p>

<p>
Although few contemporary observers fully understand the magnitude of this
transformation, there are several generalizations that can be offered.
First, every indication is that reliance on digital information will
increase in virtually every segment of society, ranging from the home, to
government, and to the workplace.
</p>

<p>
From Charles Dollar: (B) National Archives of the United States Archival
Preservation System: This is based on the concept of transferring or
copying electronic records in bit form from one media and associated
recording format to the same or different media with the same or different
recording format without the loss of authenticity or integrity.

60 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1985). It is interesting to
note, that while the importance of the Rosetta Stone was instantly
recognized, its existence did not make the solution automatic. Furthermore,
it was probably never the intent of the Egyptians to communicate with
future generations. By providing a third language, Greek, which survived
longer than their own, the Egyptians provided a code breaker for their
hieroglyphics. For this and other information about communicating
information to future generations see Thomas A. Sebeok, Communication

64. Federal cylinder project: A loss of provenance has already occurred for
an entire class of machine recorded information. The description of a large
part of the Library of Congress' early cylinder field recording,
documenting the traditional culture of America and the world, has been
lost. ". . . the cylinder collections had not always been carefully
organized and cataloged in the first place, and their subsequent
orphan-like history, shuttled from boxes under beds to boxes in a variety
of institutional basements, succeeded in dispersing much of the information
about the cylinders to the winds. To the preservation challenge then, was
added a major organizing and cataloging challenge". Also, the sound on the
cylinders was at great risk of being lost. Many cylinders could be played
only once before they disintegrated. Now that the sound had been
transferred from the disks, there is a possibility of saving it forever.
