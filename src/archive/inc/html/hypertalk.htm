<h3>Go</h3>

<p>The go command can be used in two ways. It can allow the user to go to any card in the stack that it is  in or to any card of any other stack that is available.</p>

<pre>
visual effect dissolve
go to card id 3807
</pre>

<h3>Put/Set</h3>

<p>To change the text value, or textstyle of a field:</p>

<pre>
on mouseUp
  put random(100) into card field "target"
  set the textstyle of card field "Title" to italic
end mouseUp
</pre>

<p>Alternative, one can use the "type" command if the programmer wants to simulate someone typing something into a field. The type command will do very well here:</p>

<pre>
on mouseUp
  select before first line of card field "target"
  type "hello there"
end mouseUp
</pre>

<h3>Show/Hide</h3>

<p>The hide command can be used to hide any object. Some examples are: buttons, fields, and the menubar. The opposite of the hide command is  the show command, and it can be used to make an object show up again. </p>

<pre>
-- a comment
onmouseUp 
  hide card field "title" 
  wait 5 seconds 
  show card field "title" 
endmouseUp
</pre>

<p>Each of the tools in the tool menu has a name that can be used with this command.</p>

<pre>

  set dragSpeed to 150 
  drag from 300,100 to 400, 200 
  wait 1 second

<h3>Play</h3>

<p>The play command plays the specified sequence of notes with the specified sampled sounds. The tempo parameter specifies the number of quarter notes per minute; the default value is 120. </p>

<pre>play "harpsichord" "c4 a3 f c4 a3 f c4 d c c c"</pre>

<h3>Globals</h3>

<p>The global command is  used to specify variables which will be available to other scripts within the stack or even in another stack. Unless variables are declared a global, they are considered by HyperTalk as local which means that they may only be used within a single script. If they are global, they may be carried to other scripts. Variables must be identified before they are used in order for them to become global. </p>

<pre>
-- allow access to globals
global var1, var2, ..
answer "hello " & var1 & "."
</pre>
