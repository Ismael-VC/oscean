<p>The game was released in collaboration with John Eternal, for mobile in 2016, and re-released for Desktop in 2017 as Hundred Rabbits. While the game was designed on a train, without internet connection during Train Jam 2015, it seemed like Donsol's gameplay accidentally ended up quite similar to Zach Gage and Kurt Bieg's <a href=''http://stfj.net/index2.php?project=art/2011/Scoundrel.pdf>Scoundrel</a>, designed in 2011.</p>
