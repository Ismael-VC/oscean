<p>Permacomputing does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating a dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenunity to finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition into co-operation and {adaptation waste into resources}.</p>
<p>It values maintenance and encourages programmers to refactor and rewrite programs to keep them small and efficient, instead of counting on Mooreâ€™s law to compensate for {stack software bloat}.</p>

<p>Instead of {commodity planned obsolescence}, permacomputing practices planned {longtermism longevity}, reuse and repair of existing technology and approaches waste as a resource.</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of a product can be disassembled for repair and for {commodity end of life}. This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a product's life cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken apart at the end of its life so that each component can be reclaimed. Among other shifts in thinking and making, this means minimizing materials, using simple mechanical fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling components with their material type, and ensuring components can be disassembled with everyday tools. </p>
<p>Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a <i>sustainable</i> product, designing a product for disassembly is a more concrete, quantifiable approach to ecologically sound making and to consumption. </p>
