<p>The device is the result of a collaboration between Teenage Engineering, a company who makes disposable electronics and Panic, a company who writes proprietary development software for the platform that most aggressively fights against the Right To Repair. The result is a sort of <a href='simulacra.html'>premium mediocre</a> boutique handheld with excellent devtools.</p>

<p>It's surprisingly is easy to take the Playdate apart and access and replace the battery(standard 740mAh 3.7VLiPO) with a slotted screwdriver. We did not recieve our pre-sale unit with a disassembly manual nor the tools to open the case. The playdate is lacking select and start buttons, leaving only a d-pad, 2 buttons and a crank.</p>

<h3>Why Bother</h3>

<p>It's a fair question to ask why I even bother, and if my interest in the device might not inadvertently generate more electronic waste by encouraging others to buy that sort of products. My documenting the device and its ecosystem is <b><i>not an endorsement</i></b>. At this time, the device is still unreleased, the official documentation principally focuses on complex toolchains for Windows and OSX - Maybe by collecting some notes I can help the consumers who already own the device, or those who were going to get the device, to take control of their playdate and find a purpose for it.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>The PlayDate documention focuses on building Lua projects using either VS Code or X Code, we will setup a <a href='ansi_c.html'>plain C</a> project without relying on an IDE.</p>

<p>You need to install the <a href='https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/arm-none-eabi-gcc/' target='_blank'>GNU cross compiler for ARM EABI(bare-metal)</a> to be able to make arm compatible binaries. It should include <code>libnewlib-arm-none-eabi(arm-none-eabi-newlib)</code> which is also needed.</p>

<p>We'll simply use <code>make</code> as opposed to the ninja/cmake toolchain suggested in the official documentation. For an example project, you can have a look at the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-playdate/tree'>Uxn Emulator</a>.</p>

<p>WORK IN PROGRESS</p>
