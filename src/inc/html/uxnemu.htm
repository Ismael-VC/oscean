<p>Devices are external systems to the Uxn code such as the screen, the mouse, the keyboard, etc. There is a maximum of 16 devices, each device has 16 bytes of I/O memory.</p>

<h2>Devices</h2>

<p>An emulator implementation can choose which device to implement or to leave out, these are the suggested addresses and ports of this specific emulator.</p>

<p>The screen device is made of two overlayed screen buffers that make up the pixels on the screen. The available drawing modes are as follow: <b>single pixel</b>, <b>1bpp sprite</b> and <b>2pbb sprite</b>. </p>
<p>Drawing requires setting values to the screen's <code>x*</code>, <code>y*</code> and <code>color</code>, the sprite modes also require an <code>addr*</code> which points to the <a href='chr_format.html'>sprite data</a> in memory. The <b>color byte</b> defines the layer to draw on, the type of data to draw, and the colors to use. </p>

<pre>
* * M L            D C B A

| | +------ Mode   | | +------ Blend   
| +-------- Flipx  | +-------- Blend  
+---------- Flipy  +---------- Blend  
</pre>

<p>Sprites are 8x8 tiles, stored in memory as sequences of 8 bytes for a 1bpp sprite, and 16 bytes for a 2bpp sprite. For example, the color byte <code>#21</code> will paint a 1bpp sprite on the background with the first system color, and <code>#52</code> will paint a 2bpp sprite on the foreground with the second system color. </p>

<h3 id='audio'>Audio Device</h3>

<img src='../media/generic/uxn.apu.jpg' style='float:right' width='240' />

<p>When <code>pitch</code> is written to any of the audio devices, it starts playing an audio sample from Uxn's memory, pointed to by <code>addr*</code> and <code>length*</code>. It loops the sample (unless told not to) until it reaches the end of the ADSR envelope defined by <code>adsr*</code>.</p>

<p>Several fields contain more than one component:</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th></th><th colspan='4'>ADSR*</th><th colspan='2'>Pitch</th><th colspan='2'>Volume</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Subfield</th><td>Attack</td><td>Decay</td><td>Sustain</td><td>Release</td><td>Loop</td><td>Note</td><td>Left</td><td>Right</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Size (bits)</th><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Each of the ADSR components is measured in 15ths of a second, so writing <code>#ffff</code> to <code>adsr*</code> will play a note that lasts for exactly four seconds, with each section of the envelope lasting one second. If <code>adsr*</code> is <code>#0000</code> then no envelope will be applied: this is most useful for longer samples that are set to play once by setting the most significant bit of <code>pitch</code> to 1.</p>

<p>The envelope varies the amplitude as follows: starting at 0%, rising to 100% over the Attack section, falling to 50% over the Decay section, remaining at 50% throughout the Sustain section and finally falling to 0% over the Release section. The envelope is linearly interpolated throughout each section.</p>

<p>The two <code>volume</code> components set how loudly the next sample will play. <code>#ff</code> sets maximum volume for both speakers.</p>

<p>When <code>pitch</code> is written, any sample that is currently playing will be replaced with the sample defined by all the values set in the device. While the sample is playing, the <code>output</code> byte can be read to find the loudness of the envelope at that moment.</p>

<h4>Audio Sample Format</h4>

<p>All samples used by the audio devices are mono and unsigned 8-bit (also known as <b>u8</b>), so the space taken up by samples is minimized. The sample rate of the samples depends on <code>length*</code>:</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th><code>length*</code></th><th>Sample type</th><th>Sample rate</th></tr>
	<tr><td>&gt; 256</td><td>Middle-C pitched sample</td><td>44,100 Hz</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2â€“256</td><td>Single wavelength</td><td>Variable</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Long samples are assumed to be already pitched to Middle C and will loop (unless No Loop is 1) until the end of the envelope. To play the sample at the same rate as it was recorded, write the Middle C MIDI note number, <code>#3c</code>, to <code>pitch</code>. To play at double or half speed, for example, write an octave higher or lower to <code>pitch</code>.</p>

<p>The minimum sample size that can be pitched at 44.1 kHz to Middle C with reasonable accuracy is 337 bytes long, which represents two cycles of the 261 Hz wave. The single wavelength mode in Uxn allows much smaller samples to be used, even down to only two bytes for a square wave. In this mode the length of the entire sample is taken to be one cycle of the Middle C note, so the pitch is not heard to vary even if <code>length*</code> were to change between sample plays.</p>

<h3 id='controller'>Controller Device</h3>

<p>This button byte works similarly to a NES controller, where there the state of each one of the 8 buttons is stored as a bit in a single byte. The keys byte contains the ascii character that is currently pressed.</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><td><code>0x01</code></td><td>Ctrl</td><td><code>0x10</code></td><td>Up</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code>0x02</code></td><td>Alt</td><td><code>0x20</code></td><td>Down</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code>0x04</code></td><td>Shift</td><td><code>0x40</code></td><td>Left</td></tr>
	<tr><td><code>0x08</code></td><td>Escape</td><td><code>0x80</code></td><td>Right</td></tr>
</table>

<h3 id='console'>Console Device</h3>

<p>The console device is the standard I/O device, it allows for communication between programs on the host computer, or even between instances of Uxn. To send data from one Uxn to another, use the following pattern:</p>
