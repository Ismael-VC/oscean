<p>The Andes Castel is a large unnatural structure found in Laeisth.</p>

<p>Injected into <a href='dinaisth.html'>dinaisth</a> by <a href='andes.html'>andes</a>, the castellum is a seemingly artificial structure found North of the <a href='laeisth.html'>Laeisth Desert</a>.</p>
<p>While its intricate networks of ornate tunnels and decorated halls appear to suggest its creation to be the result of artificial construction â€”  It was found by the <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Neon Hermetists</a> to have come into being from the natural sway of the <a href='kanikule.html'>ocean</a>, erosion and accumulation of debris, across a long period of time.</p>
<p>When looking North from the <a href='laeisth.html'>Oasis</a>, three High Towers, connected by bridges, are visible above the horizon. Its very existence suggest an <a href='soies_injection.html'>injection</a> into the <a href='soies.html'>soies</a>.</p>
<p>The bridge connecting the center, and highest, Tower(B) to the rightmost one(C)(when observed from the Oasis) has been sectioned. A silhouette of the Castel can be seen on the <a href='neauismetica.html'>neauismetica</a> sigil.</p>
