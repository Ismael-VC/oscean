<h2>The Soies Machine is a sort of clock that forces time into ticking.</h2>

<p>The <b>Soies Machine</b> rotates at the fastest allowed speed by the <a href='soies.html'>Occurence</a> without exiting into impossibilities. The original purpose of these machines was to locate, and traverse into, the <a href='longest_end.html'>Longest End</a>.</p>

<p>Sealed in a <i>Cartesian Vaccum</i>, the clock spins inside a pocket of synthetic space ruled by optimal natural laws; an uttermost stable vaccum. in wich each "needle" rotate in its own dimension, vanishing upon reaching the fatest renderable possibility â€” Effectively locating the <b>occurring</b> within the possibles and impossible spaces.</p>
