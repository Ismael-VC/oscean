<h2>Vetetrandes is the remains of a city where Yajnev rests.</h2>

<p>As you would approach the epicenter of the bound city, time would become increasingly more <a href='soies_machine.html'>unmoving</a>.</p>
<p>At its center, one would find the corpse of <a href='yajnev.html'>yajnev</a>, and where Yajnev's head would have been, a hollow mask. Locked inside the mask is the only instance of true space that can be said to be "outside". Vetetrandes is located between <a href='risan_aldeth.html'>Risan Aldeth</a> and Clionn, on the southern hemisphere of <a href='dinaisth.html'>Dinaisth</a>.</p>
<p>The trek across Vetetrandes is only possible through the guiding of an <a href='actors.html'>Actor</a>, as the local void existing in Vetetrandes is unacted, or unoperated and unredered.</p>
<p>The <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Neon Hermetists</a> believe this location to be an ancient and broken <a href='soies_machine.html'>soies_machine</a>.</p>
