<h2>Various Language notes on natural, synthetic and programming languages.</h2>

<p>Welcome to the <b>Language Portal</b>, the goal of these pages is to host a few resources, summaries and notes from my own language studies. I've moved all notes about programming languages <a href='programming.html'>here</a>, and math things <a href='arithmetic.html'>here</a>. Additional notes can be found in the <a href='notebook.html'>notebook</a>.</p>
