<p>Domine is a 2-players domino game.</p>

<p>The goal is to have the most “living” dominoes at the end of the round. The kit used here, is the <i>Double 9</i> domino set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player draws a hand of seven dominoes and keeps them hidden from their opponent. The two numbers on either side of a domino are the attack and defense points, facing the opponent and the player respectively. The dominoes can be flipped as long as it’s before they are played.</li>
<li>Each turn consists of an attack using a domino and choosing which is the attack side and which is the defense.</li>
<li>Players alternate turns until all dominoes have been played. The player with the most living dominoes wins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Attack Rules</h3>
<p>When a player attacks with a domino, the opponent must defend with a value equal to or higher than the attack. If the opponent’s domino defense value is lower than the attack, the domino is killed. If the opponent’s domino defense value is equal to or higher, then they have survived. If the opponent can defend and has an attack number higher than the player’s domino defense value, the opponent can counter to kill the player’s domino. Double dominoes get first strike, regardless if they initiate the attack.</p>
