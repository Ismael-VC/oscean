<table border="1">
	<tr><th>BREAK</th><td>Controls the handling of program interruption with Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break.</td></tr>

	<tr><th>CHDIR, CD</th><td>Changes the current working directory or displays the current directory.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>CLS</th><td>Clears the screen.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>COPY</th><td>Copies one file to another (if the destination file already exists, MS-DOS asks whether to replace it). (See also XCOPY, an external command that could also copy directory trees).</td></tr>
	<tr><th>CTTY</th><td>Defines the device to use for input and output.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>DATE</th><td>Display and set the date of the system.</td></tr>

	<tr><th>MKDIR, MD</th><td>Creates a new directory.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>PATH</th><td>Displays or changes the value of the PATH environment variable which controls the places where COMMAND.COM will search for executable files.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>PROMPT</th><td>Displays or change the value of the PROMPT environment variable which controls the appearance of the prompt.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>RENAME, REN</th><td>Renames a file or directory.</td></tr>

<h3>Piping</h3>

<p>Because DOS is a single-tasking operating system, piping is achieved by running commands sequentially, redirecting to and from a temporary file.</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>command < filename</code> Redirect standard input from a file or device</li>
	<li><code>command > filename</code> Redirect standard output, overwriting target file if it exists.</li>
	<li><code>command >> filename</code> Redirect standard output, appending to target file if it exists.</li>
	<li><code>command1 | command2</code> Pipe standard output from command1 to standard input of command2</li>
	<li><code>command1 ¶ command2</code> Commands separated by ASCII-20 (¶, invoked by Ctrl+T) are executed in sequence (chaining of commands)</li>
</ul>

<h3>DosBox</h3>

<p>To refresh the mounted folder, use <code>rescan</code>.To mount a folder from the host computer:</p>

<pre>mount c ~/path/to/folder
C:</pre>

<p>To add a new folder to your PATH:</p>

<pre>SET PATH=%1;C:\TC</pre>

<h3>Turbo C</h3>

<p>To work with multiple files with Turbo C, you need to create a <code>*.PRJ</code> file with the name of the files to be included in your project, and set this filename under the <code>Project</code> menu.</p>

<pre>
MAIN.C
INCLUDE.C
EXTRAS.C
</pre>
