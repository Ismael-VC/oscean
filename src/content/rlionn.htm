<h2>Rlionn is a being who periodically manifest itself on Laeisth.</h2>

<p>Rlionn is not a single individual but a trait that manifests itself for the inhabitants of <a href='laeisth.html'>Laeisth</a> as sort of lucidity that drives its "children" to embark on a walk across the deserts toward <a href='paradichlorisse.html'>Paradichlorisse</a>.</p>
<p>Spoken-of in tales and songs, the stories of Rlionn and the procession of its subjects are sung in the album <a href='children_of_bramble.html'>children_of_bramble</a>.</p>
