<h2>Hako is a 2 players dice game.</h2>

<p>The game was originally played by the Iridi people in <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>. Hako is played with 8 dice, where each face is painted as 4 triangles with 2 colors. A paper hako dice can be made from a <a href='origami.html'>sonobe 6</a>. The Iridi die is a painted stone.</p>

<p>There are 6 different sides to a hako die. The fully clear side is called <i>day</i>, the fully painted is called <i>night</i>, the side with two connected triangles is called <i>dusk</i>, the side with two disconnected triangle is called <i>dawn</i>, the remaining sides are called <i>null-moon</i> or <i>full-moon</i>.</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>Players each pick a color, and begin with 4 dice.</p>

<p>Each turn, a player rolls a die and try to surround a die in play, with 4 triangles of its own color. After playing their last die, players must pick dice in play which were not played last, and which do not create a floating die. The game ends when a player manages to surround a die. A <b>floating die</b> is one with no immediate non-diagonal neighbor.</p>

<p>In this example game, the player with the unpainted triangles wins.</p>
