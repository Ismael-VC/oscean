<h3>How to Play</h3>

<p>Players each pick a color, and begin with four dice. Each turn, a player rolls a die and try to surround a die in play, with four triangles of its own color. </p>

<p>After playing their last die, players must pick one in play which was not played last, and that does not create a floating die. A <b>floating die</b> is has no immediate non-diagonal neighbor. The game ends when a player surrounds a die with four triangles of their color.</p>
