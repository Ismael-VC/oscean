<p>We sailed to Ogasawara in the late winter of 2019, from Fiji.</p>

<p>We sailed into the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonin_Islands' target='_blank'>Futami arbor</a> on our way to <a href='shizuoka.html'>Shizuoka</a>, from the <a href='marshall_islands.html'>marshall islands</a>.</p>
<p>The island of Chichijima is one of the most beautiful place I have had the chance of spending time at, it exists at the intersection of my favourite climate and <a href='nutrition.html'>foods</a>. We spent our time there <a href='bike.html'>cycling</a> up and down the coastal slopes, and cooking delicious meals from our favourite Japanese ingredients.</p>
<p>Reaching the Japanese island marked the completion of a <a href='goals.html'>dream of mine</a>.</p>
