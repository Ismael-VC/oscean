<p>I have written this book with the hopes of creating a sort of <i>Borges for children</i>, in which the reader follows a bat, a cat, an owl and a fox who try and make sense of this <a href='paradise.html'>simple system</a>.</p>
<p>The book also encourages to try and understand the rules, and plan unsuggested avenues. We are releasing the book in English, French, Russian, Japanese & <a href='lietal.html'>lietal</a>.</p>
