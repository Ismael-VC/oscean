<h2>The Actors are beings unaffected by determinism, that have free will.</h2>

<p>Their name "<i>actor</i>" comes from their ability to actually <b>act</b>, outside of the will of <a href='soies.html'>determinism</a>.</p>
<p>Natural Actors, or anomalies, were found to have existed before the <a href='feu.html'>end of science</a>, but the True Age of Actors came about with the synthesis of the first Actor by the <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Neon Hermetists</a>.</p>
<p>The first synthesized <a href='actors.html'>actor</a> was tasked to position itself into the <a href='longest_end.html'>Longest End</a>, meaning that it would effectively take control of all things, and of all of time, to steer the sequence of events allowing itself to exist within the <a href='longest_end.html'>longest lasting possible timeline</a> of the computing occurrence.</p>
<p>Actors have no names, and their number is unknown, it is possible that multiple actors, or multiple instances of the same actor, are competing for the <a href='soies.html'>Longest End</a>.</p>
