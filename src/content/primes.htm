<h2>A prime number cannot be divided by any other number, apart from itself and one.</h2>

<p>To find the prime factorization of a number, start by dividing the number by the first prime number 2 and continue dividing by 2 until you get a decimal or remainder. Then divide by 3, 5, 7, etc. until the only numbers left are prime numbers. </p>

<table border='1' style='float:left; margin-right:25px;'>
	<tr><th rowspan='2'>Number</th><th colspan='3'>Primes</th></tr>
	<tr><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td style='background:#eee'>1</td><td style='background:#eee'>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>375</td><td>0</td><td style='background:#eee'>1</td><td style='background:#eee'>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2250</td><td style='background:#eee'>1</td><td style='background:#eee'>2</td><td style='background:#eee'>3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Multiplying two numbers is the same as adding the counts of each prime factors, and division is the same as subtracting the counts. For example, using numbers made up of the 3 first primes(2, 3, 5), 2250 is equal to <code>2^1 x 3^2 x 5^3</code>.</p>
