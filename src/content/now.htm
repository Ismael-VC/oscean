<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the <a href='uxn.html'>uxn</a> project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the second one will be about the varvara computer and the last one will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>
