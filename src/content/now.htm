<h2>In the now.</h2>

<p><code>20T</code> ; Rewrote <a href='dexe.html'>Dexe</a> to be compatible to the latest changes to <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> as we made our way back down toward Victoria. I'm unsure what to do with the wiki's twtxt and RSS feeds, generating them in Uxntal will be ready painful. Maybe I could merge the now page's body, but then I would loose the <a href='varvara.html'>Arvelie</a> timestamps, and links.</p>

<p><code>20S</code> ; Made it to False Creek. The grey weather gives us only a few hours of solar power each day, so we alternate between cleaning and doing other things, such as <a href='origami.html'>origami</a>. I've been optimizing <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, trying to make it run faster, following in the line of optimizations of <a href='noodle.htm'>Noodle</a>. </p>

<p><code>20R</code> ; Currently rewriting <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> in <a href='uxntal.html'>uxntal</a>, as an experiment to see how far I can push <a href='uxn.html'>uxn</a>, and what a wiki-from-first-principles might look like. A few features have yet to be ported, but the main components are done. We're slowly sailing North toward Vancouver to see friends, we left Saturna for Ladysmith and Silva Bay, <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> has engine problems, again. </p>

<p><code>20Q</code> ; Completed <a href='noodle.htm'>Noodle</a>, anchored near <a href='canada.html'>Saturna</a>. It's nice to be sailing and working off-grid again. I've started writing <a href='paradise.html'>paradise</a> in <a href='uxntal.html'>uxntal</a>, it would be nice to port <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> at some point too. I'm thinking that maybe I should stop logging my days now, it has been 16 years, I think I've tried everything I wanted to try.</p>
