<h2>In the now.</h2>

<p><code>20R</code> ; Currently rewriting <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> in <a href='uxntal.html'>uxntal</a>, as an experiment to see how far I can push <a href='uxn.html'>uxn</a>, and what a wiki-from-first-principles might look like. A few features have yet to be ported, but the main components are done. We're slowly sailing North toward Vancouver to see friends, we left Saturna for Ladysmith and Silva Bay, <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> has engine problems, again. </p>

<p><code>20Q</code> ; Completed <a href='noodle.htm'>Noodle</a>, anchored near <a href='canada.html'>Saturna</a>. It's nice to be sailing and working off-grid again. I've started writing <a href='paradise.html'>paradise</a> in <a href='uxntal.html'>uxntal</a>, it would be nice to port <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> at some point too. I'm thinking that maybe I should stop logging my days now, it has been 16 years, I think I've tried everything I wanted to try.</p>
