<h2>In the now.</h2>

<p><code>20W</code> ; Wrote a little <a href='brainfuck.html'>brainfuck</a> interpreter in <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> while traveling. My toughts have been drifting back to <a href='primes.html'>primes</a> and <a href='fractions.html'>fractions</a> for computing, I've been considering a twist to <a href='fractran.html'>fractran</a> where fractions with a zero as nominator or denominator might be used for as jump operations, but I have yet to implement this.</p>

<p><code>20V</code> ; Decided to stop doing daily drawings and port <a href='donsol.html'>Donsol</a> instead. I had it all planned out in my head before starting, I went ahead and completed the port within just a few days. The work was done on a Pinebook Pro, revealing a few issues with <a href='left.html'>Left</a>, so I spent some time optimizing the text-editor so it would run faster.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Released <a href='donsol.html'>Donsol</a>, for <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>.</li>
	<li>Added a <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>reference manual</a> for the <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> opcodes.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>20U</code> ; Spending the month of October between <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/statuses/107033448028097574' target='_blank'>daily drawings</a>, and various <a href='https://100r.co/site/growing_food.html' target='_blank'>food preservation projects</a>. As I work on a picture, I'll occasionally stop and improve <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a> is some way or another. The near totality of my computer activities(drawing, composing and programming) are now done from within the <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> virtual machine. <i>I couldn't be happier</i>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added guides for the line and rect tool, in <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>.</li>
	<li>Added interface responsiveness, in <a href='dexe.html'>Dexe</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>20T</code> ; Rewrote <a href='dexe.html'>Dexe</a> to be compatible to the latest changes to <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>. I'm unsure what to do about Oscean's twtxt and RSS feeds, generating them in Uxntal will be hard, especially the date conversion. Maybe I could build the now page's body from the twtxt feed, but if I did, I would loose the <a href='varvara.html'>Arvelie</a> timestamps and links. Picked up <a href='moogle.html'>Moogle</a> again, cleaned up the codebase.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added 1-bit output format, in <a href='moogle.html'>Moogle</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>20S</code> ; The grey weather gives us only a few hours of solar power each day, so we alternate between cleaning and doing other things, such as <a href='origami.html'>origami</a>. I've been optimizing <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>, trying to make it run faster, following in the line of optimizations of <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Added d-pad controls, in <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>20R</code> ; Currently rewriting <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> in <a href='uxntal.html'>uxntal</a>, as an experiment to see how far I can push <a href='uxn.html'>uxn</a>, and what a wiki-from-first-principles might look like. A few features have yet to be ported, but the main components are done. We're slowly sailing North toward Vancouver to see friends, we left Saturna for Ladysmith and Silva Bay, <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a> has engine problems, again. </p>

<p><code>20Q</code> ; Completed <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, anchored near <a href='canada.html'>Saturna</a>. It's nice to be sailing and working off-grid again. I've started porting <a href='paradise.html'>paradise</a> in <a href='uxntal.html'>uxntal</a>, it would be nice to port <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> at some point too. I'm considering stopping to keep a daily diary now, it has been 16 years, I think I've tried everything I wanted to try.</p>
