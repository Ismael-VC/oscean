<h2>2022</h2>

<p><code>16B</code> ; Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a few additional translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='wireworld.html'>wireworld</a>. Time just flew by these past 14 days.</p>

<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the <a href='uxn.html'>uxn</a> project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the second one will be about the varvara computer and the last one will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>

<h3>Then</h3>
