<h2>Notes on Routine and Habits.</h2>

<p>A <b>typical day</b> usually begins at around 6:00am.</p>
<p>I tend to try and <b>keep my eyes shut</b> until I have mentally drafted a <a href='aesthetics.html'>rough plan</a> of the things I will want to have done by the end of that day. I rise to grind coffee — I usually ever <b>only drink one cup</b> per day.</p>
<p>I immediately set off to complete the task I planned in bed. I know to have about 3 hours of undisturbed flow before the distraction surrounding lunch-time pulls me away from the work. My goal for each day, is to complete <b>a single task</b> that should take about 3 hours to complete — Or between 4 to 5 pomodoros.</p>
<p>After the last pomodoro, I usually <b>cook for a half-hour</b>, and then <b>eat for a half-hour</b>, and then <b>walk for a half-hour</b>, to fully leave the haze of the <i>flowstate</i>. The afternoon is spent doing maintenance, superficial work and experiments. But mostly, the afternoon is spent reading and learning. The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake up to the next day and to experiment with.</p>
<p>The superficial work that I do involves replying to blogs & forums, editing wikipedia entries, doing maintenance to various repositories, answering emails and so on..</p>
<p>The day ends with <b>journaling for a half-hour</b> at which point I record the task done, and the <a href='mirrors.html'>lessons learned</a>. Before sleeping, I usually <b>read for a half-hour</b>, I go to bed with a <a href='reading.html'>book</a>, and a highlighter pen. I overline the things I want to keep for a later use, or to revisit.</p>
