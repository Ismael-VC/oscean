<p>Waiting For Horus was a fast paced multiplayer arena type 3rd person shooter.</p>

<p>It was originally created by <a href='http://theinstructionlimit.com' target='_blank'>Renaud Bedard</a> and I as a weekend project to play with friends over IRC.</p>

<p>I have very fond memories of building and playing this amazing project with friends. <a href='https://mangadrive.bandcamp.com' target='_blank'>Mangadrive</a> created some amazing music for the project.</p>
