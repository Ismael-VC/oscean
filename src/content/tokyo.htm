<p>Unforgettable time riding our bikes in Tokyo.</p>

<p>We have moved in and out of Tokyo a few times between 2008 and 2014, we have lived between 2010 and 2012 in Odaiba while we worked in Shinjuku, we would bike in and out of the city twice a day, each day. This was some of the happiest moments of our lives.</p>
