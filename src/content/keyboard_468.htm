<p>Keyboard 468 was a 18-keys keyboard.</p>

<p>The letters are <b>sorted by frequency</b> in the English language, and their likeliness to follow the last input character.</p>
<p>The purpose of this experimental keyboard is to have a keyboard displaying large letters, making it so you only ever need to <b>type using the two rows at the top</b>, maximizing the space and allowing for big large letters. The hidden letters are accessible through the <i>alt</i> key, alongside symbols and numbers.</p>
<p>As of March 2019, this application is <a href='unreleased.html'>no longer maintained</a>. <br />For another keyboard project, see the <a href='juni.html'>Juni Keyboard</a>.</p>
