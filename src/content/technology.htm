<h2>Technology is the active human interface with the material world.</h2>

<p>We indulge in the continual debasement of our attention and energy, get emotionally giddy as its squandered to the ignorant masses. We indulge in its <a href='commodity.html'>narcistic promotion</a>, revel in slowly becoming a greater center of attention; a center that becomes defined by various artificially created <a href='simulacra.html'>boundaries</a>. </p>

<p>The social media user does not post for enjoyment, they enjoy the indulgent masochism of its dopamine exhaustion, they indulge in it as they do a deep autumn depression, with an unconsciously mechanical action which draws them from their potential as a Being. Stripped to the core there is nothing new here, what is found once more is one's lust for sleep.<a href='https://www.meta-nomad.net/everything-happens-no-one-does-anything/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

The dark forest theory explaining that communication, because it reveals our existence to others, is a sign of stupidity rather than intelligence.</p>

<q>If we listened to people like you, more or less vagabonds and barefoot tramps, we would not have got beyond the bicycle. That's just it! we would ride bikes in the cities.</q>
