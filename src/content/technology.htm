<h2>Technology is the active human interface with the material world.</h2>

<p>We will live in this world, which for us has all the disquieting strangeness of the desert and of the simulacrum, with all the veracity of living phantoms, of wandering and simulating animals that capital, that the death of capital has made of us — because the <a href='moloch.html'>desert of cities</a> is equal to the desert of sand — the jungle of signs is equal to that of the forests — the vertigo of <a href='simulacra.html'>simulacra</a> is equal to that of nature—only the vertiginous seduction of a <a href='collapse.html'>dying system</a> remains, in which work buries work, in which <a href='commodity.html'>value</a> buries value. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<q>And a long-continuing day<br/>Was given them for the life they loved so much.<br/>For they died not by grievous ills consumed,<br/>But as o'ercome by sleep.</q>

<q>If we listened to people like you, more or less vagabonds and barefoot tramps, we would not have got beyond the bicycle. That's just it! we would ride bikes in the cities.</q>
<h5>Bernard Moitessier, The Long Way</h5>

<p>We indulge in the continual debasement of our attention and energy, get emotionally giddy as its squandered to the ignorant masses. We indulge in its narcistic promotion, revel in slowly becoming a greater center of attention; a center that becomes defined by various artificially created boundaries. The social media user does not post for enjoyment, they enjoy the indulgent masochism of its dopamine exhaustion, they indulge in it as they do a deep autumn depression, with an unconsciously mechanical action which draws them from their potential as a Being. Stripped to the core there is nothing new here, what is found once more is man’s lust for sleep.<a href='https://www.meta-nomad.net/everything-happens-no-one-does-anything/'>~</a></p>

<h3>The paradox of vertical farming</h3>

<p>Artificial lighting saves land because plants can be grown above each other, but if the electricity for the lighting comes from solar panels, then the savings are canceled out by the land required to install the solar panels.</p>

<p>In which forests are turned into paper to make newspapers that call for the forests to be saved.</p>
