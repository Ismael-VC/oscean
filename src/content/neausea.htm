<p>The Neausea is a sickness that manifests when one knows their relative position in the course of times.</p>

<p>The experience of <b>Neausea</b>, by the afflicted, would at first seem like one can travel through time. But the subject's impression of time-traveling is due to their focus shifting across alternative possible sequences of events.</p>
<p>To the observer, the subject would simply collapse, by the time the body would hit the ground, the subject's mental gaze would have traveled across different possible timelines, but would have in the process <i>lost the track of Time</i> â€” Effectively extracting themself from the Soies by becoming a mere witness.</p>
