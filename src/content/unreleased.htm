<h2>A list of Unreleased projects.</h2>

<p>Here are some notes on the reason why I have changed platforms over time, to learn more see the <a href='https://100r.co/site/story.html' target='_blank'>Hundred Rabbits story</a>.</p>
<h3 id='mobile'>Why Not iOS</h3>
<p>As I sailed across the Pacific Ocean, it became increasingly clear that building software for Apple's <a href='mobile.html'>mobile</a> ecosystem was unsustainable due to the frequent and massive toolchain updates, and the need for the latest generation of Apple device for successfuly signing and publishing to the platform.</p>
<p>Trying to maintain our iOS devices outside of western countries, or updating X Code via expensive or spotty internet was something we could no longer afford. As of march 2019, all iOS development was abandoned.</p>
<h3 id='javascript'>Why Not Electron</h3>
<p>Subsequent to the iOS development, many applications were developed for the Electron framework and web browsers. The entire toolchain, from the necessary internet connection to access the ever-changing documentation, to the building of the massive resulting application and finally its publication online, was too heavy to work off solar energy alone.
<p>After a while, I stopped maintaining and using the applications altogether to preserve energy and bandwidth.</p>
