<h2>The Neauismetica is a series of notes on the fiction of Dinaisth.</h2>

<p>The tales of the <b>Neauismetica</b> unfold on a minuscule <a href='dinaisth.html'>celestial object</a>, where three <a href='characters.html'>Immortals</a> dwell.</p>
<p>Originally written in French, "<b>Les Récits De Dinaisth</b>" begins when most things have ended, on the surface of a Satellite where the remaining immortals have gathered, and are looking up at the <b>lightless skies</b>.</p>
<p>This series of disjointed <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>concepts</a>, <a href='characters.html'>characters</a> and <a href='dinaisth.html'>places</a> are the connecting thread that lives through <a href='aliceffekt.html'>aliceffekt</a>'s music, <a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine</a>'s <a href='illustration.html'>illustrations</a>, and are the culture behind the <a href='lietal.html'>lietal</a> Language.</p><q>Immortals speak not with words, but wait for things to happen, and merely point at them.</q>
