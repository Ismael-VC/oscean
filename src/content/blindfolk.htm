<p>Blindfolk was a esoteric multiplayer programming combat game.</p>

<p>Each player programs a short script(called fighting style) for their character that will run automatically every 5 minutes, against all other players.</p>
<p>The scripts contained a series of attacks, moves and blocks, as well as responses to collisions against other players.</p>
<p>It was first created in the span of 48 hours for <a href='http://globalgamejam.org' target='_blank'>Global Game Jam 2016</a>. The game was very popular for the days after its release, but soon became too time-consuming to maintain and keep alive, and was turned off a few days later. This design was revisited and lives on as part of the upcoming game <a href='markl.html'>markl</a>.</p>
