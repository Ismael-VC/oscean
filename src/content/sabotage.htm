<h2>Sabotage means primarily: the withdrawal of efficiency</h2>

<p>Luddism was a working-class movement opposed to the political consequences of industrial capitalism. The Luddites wanted <a href='technology.html'>technology</a> to be deployed in ways that made work more humane and gave workers more <a href='technocracy.html'>autonomy</a>. The bosses, on the other hand, wanted to drive down costs and <a href='commodity.html'>increase productivity</a>.</p>

<p>A neo-Luddite movement would understand no technology is sacred in itself, but is only worthwhile insofar as it benefits society. It would confront the harms done by digital capitalism and seek to address them by giving people more power over the technological systems that structure their lives.</p>
