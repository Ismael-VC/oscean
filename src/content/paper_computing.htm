<h2>Exploring what sort of computing can be done on paper.</h2>


<h3>Color Computer</h3>

<p>Non-electronic computers that work when you color them according to a simple set of rules. The booklet contains three series of computers: computers that compare, computers that count, and computers that play. From a technical standpoint they are all NOR-based logic circuits designed by using truth tables, karnaugh maps, and maxterm expansions. </p>

<p>From a social, political, and environmental perspective, these computers are an exploration of computation without electricity and semiconductors, an attempt to reinvent digital systems away from efficiency and productivity, and a hopeful prototype to expose the inner workings of computers.<a href='https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYz7DPRWypGQcbAHr7Mi8EKB6ntSPsEnUsCXbAhBiHQZP/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<h3>Nomograms</h3>

<p>A nomogram is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a function. Each variable is marked along a scale, and a line drawn through known scale values (or a straightedge placed across them) will cross the value of the unknown variable on its scale. <br />Example: 3 x 4 = 12</p>

<h3>Visual Multiplication</h3>

<p>The stick method of multiplication involves properly placing and crossing sticks. You simply lay out sticks consistent with the place values of the digits being multiplied. Then, you count the places where the sticks cross. <br />Example: 62 x 21 = 1302</p>

<h3>Lattice Multiplication</h3>

<p>Lattice multiplication is a method of multiplication that uses a lattice to multiply two multi-digit numbers. <br />Example: 64 x 17 = 1088</p>

<q>Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his contrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.</q>
