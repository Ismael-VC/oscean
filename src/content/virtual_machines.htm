<h2>A collection of experimental computing systems.</h2>

<p>A VM is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components, allowing it to perform arithmetic, read and write to memory, and interact with I/O devices, just like a physical computer. Most importantly, it can understand a machine language which you can use to program it. To see examples of this in action, see <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> or <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>.</p>
