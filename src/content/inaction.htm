<h2>A collection of notes in regard to Inaction.</h2>

<p><b>Wu Wei</b> means without doing, causing, or making. It flows like water, reflects like a mirror, and responds like an echo.</p>
<q>Many people are afraid of Emptiness, <br />because it reminds them of Loneliness.</q>

<h3>inaction wisdom</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Establishment of an always perfect tolerance, irrespective of the actions and words of others towards oneself.</li>
	<li>Truthfulness (to say only what is right).</li>
	<li>Rejection of hatred and worship. Not to follow any particular idea. Maintaining the mind in equanimity.</li>
</ul>

<q>When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow and exclude people. so create.</q>
