<h2>Oquonie is a textless isometric puzzle game.</h2>

<p>You must make your way through a seemingly endless succession of rooms. You will not be alone. Your incarnations will have the help of <b>bizaroid</b> characters that speak an <a href='camilare.html'>an obscure language</a>.</p>
<p>We made Oquonie while living in <a href='japan.html'>japan</a>. The game was our first collaborative project as <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>hundred rabbits</a>, and a reflection of our experience navigating a new country, with language as a recurent obstacle. Oquonie is about being lost in a foreign space.</p>
<p>A big inspiration for this project was the short story "A town without streets" by Junji Ito, about a city of endless interconnecting houses and rooms, where privacy is non-existent. To preserve the little privacy they do have, the townspeople wear masks.</p>

<p>Back in 2013, we both had full-time jobs in different studios in Tokyo, we worked on Oquonie after work, and on weekends, for a total of 6 months. You can learn more about the development of the project <a href='https://100r.co/site/oquonie.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
<p>Oquonie features an original <a href='oquonie_soundtrack.html'>soundtrack</a>, and was best described as <a href='http://killscreendaily.com/articles/oquonie-maze-worth-entering/' target='_blank'>Animal Crossing in a K-Hole</a>. You can find help in the <a href='camilare.html'>Oquonie Guide</a>.</p>
