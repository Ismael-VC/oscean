<h2>On wood as a fuel for a small boat.</h2>

<p>Unlike oil, coal, or gas, wood is a renewable resource. Wood gives off the same amount of carbon whether it is burned up or decays naturally and is considered Carbon Neutral if a new tree is planted where one has fallen. Over the course of a tree's life it absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then releases carbon dioxide that was previously accumulated back into the environment when it either decomposes naturally or is burned.</p>
