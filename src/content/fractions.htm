<h2>A fraction represents a part of a whole.</h2>

<p>A fraction consists of a numerator displayed above a line, and a denominator below.</p>

<ul>
	<li>An <b>proper fraction</b> must be less than 1, like <code>3/4</code> and <code>7/12</code>.</li>
	<li>An <b>improper fraction</b> is more than 1, like <code>9/2</code> and <code>13/4</code>.</li>
	<li>The <b>reciprocal of a fraction</b> is another fraction with the numerator and denominator exchanged, like <code>3/7</code> for <code>7/3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reducing</h3>

<p>Dividing the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number yields an equivalent fraction: if the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are both divisible by a number (called a factor) greater than 1, then the fraction can be reduced to an equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator.</p>

<h4>Subtraction Method</h4>
<pre>
function gcd(a, b)
	if b = 0
		return a
	else
		return gcd(b, a mod b)</pre>

<h4>Recursive Method</h4>
<pre>
function gcd(a, b)
	if b = 0
		return a
	else
		return gcd(b, a mod b)</pre>

<h2>Comparing</h2>

<p>Comparing fractions with the same positive denominator yields the same result as comparing the numerators.</p>

<h2>Addition/Subtraction</h2>
<p>To add fractions containing unlike quantities , it is necessary to convert all amounts to like quantities. </p>
<pre>
1/4 + 1/3
1*3/4*3 + 1*4/3*4
3/12 + 4/12 = 7/12</pre>

<p>The process for subtracting fractions is, in essence, the same as that of adding them: find a common denominator, and change each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the chosen common denominator.</p>

<h2>Multiplication</h2>
<p>To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.</p>

<pre>
2/3 * 3/4 = 6/12</pre>
