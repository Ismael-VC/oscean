<p>Paradichlorisse is a machine that speaks Nohlxeserre.</p>

<p>Its purpose is unknown, but it was "observed" to be reciting a story in a fashion that ressembled the traversal of <a href='soies.html'>Soies</a>.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized, that upon reaching its location, one would infinitely collapse as they would begin experiencing that very event and all others being told back to them, for ever.</p>
<p><i>When Paradichlorisse spoke of silence, silence fell.</i></p>
<q>It is because I cannot see what you see that I can see at all.</q>
