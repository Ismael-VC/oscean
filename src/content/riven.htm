<p>Riven is a flow-based web framework.</p>

<p><b>Riven</b> handles the creation of nodes and the communication of signals between them.</p>
<p>For more than two years, it existed as the front-end framework of <a href='oscean.html'>oscean</a> until it was replaced, but was originally developed for the creation of serverless websites.</p>
<p>This project is not meant to be an optimial way of building web applications, but a mere experimental framework to toy with the concepts of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming' target='_blank'>flow-based programming</a>. The work done on Riven later advised the development of the FBP playground <a href='noton.html'>Noton</a>.</p>
