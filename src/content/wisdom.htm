<p>A collection of notes on Wisdom.</p>

<p>The end of the cycle is that of the independent, clear-minded, all-seeing Child. That is the level known as <b>wisdom</b>.</p>
<p>To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of <b>simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust</b>.</p>
<q>There are two wisdoms: the first inclines to <a href='action.html'>action</a>, the second to <a href='inaction.html'>inaction</a>.</q>
