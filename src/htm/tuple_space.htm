<h2>Tuple spaces is a coordination model for communication in parallel computing environments.</h2>

<p>A tuple space is a place where processes can put, read, and take tuples, which are in turn just sequences of values. For example, <code>("job", 12, 1.23)</code> is a tuple made up of a string, an integer, and a floating-point number; a tuple space can contain zero or more copies of that tuple, or of tuples containing other types of values, simple or complex.</p>

<p>A process puts something in tuple space with <code>put(a, b, c, ...)</code>, take something out with <code>take(a, b, c, ...)</code>, or copy something leaving the original in tuple space with <code>copy(a, b, c, ...)</code>. The arguments to <code>take</code> and <code>copy</code> are either actual values, or variables with specific types; values match themselves, while types match things of that type. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>put("job", 12, 1.23)</code> puts the tuple ("job", 12, 1.23) in the tuple space</li>
	<li>if f is a floating point variable, <code>take("job", 12, ?f)</code> takes that tuple out of tuple space, assigning 1.23 to f</li>
	<li>but <code>take("job", 15, ?f)</code> blocks, because there is no tuple in tuple space matching the pattern (12 doesn't match 15)</li>
	<li>and if i is an integer variable, <code>copy("job", ?i, ?f)</code> assigns 12 to i and 1.23 to f, but leaves the tuple in tuple space.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are non-blocking versions of <code>take</code> and <code>copy</code> called <code>try_take</code> and <code>try_copy</code> that either match right away and return true, assigning values to variables in their patterns, or fail to match, don't do any assignment, and return false.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
	<li><code>put</code>: Puts a tuple into the tuplespace</li>
	<li><code>take</code>: Takes out a tuple that matches a given pattern from the tuplespace (if there's no match, the operation is blocked)</li>
	<li><code>copy</code>: Copies a tuple that matches a given pattern from the tuplespace (if there's no match, the operation is blocked)</li>
	<li><code>try_take</code>: A non-blocking version of <code>in</code> (if there's no match, an error message is returned)</li>
	<li><code>try_copy</code>: A non-blocking version of <code>rd</code> (if there's no match, an error message is returned)</li>
</ul>
