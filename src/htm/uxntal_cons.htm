<h2>A cons cell is a data structure which holds a bit of data and the address of the following cell.</h2>

<p>One slot is known as the CAR, and the other is known as the CDR. The purpose is so that ordered lists can be traversed by going from one cell to the next, it also allows one to change the order of cells without manually moving any of the cells' data.</p>

<h3>Nested Lists</h3>

<p>If we consider the following nested list:</p>

<pre>( cat ( dog bat ) ant )</pre>

<p>By prefixing each list with a dummy cell made of <code>data</code>, <code>next_cell</code> and <code>first_cell</code>, we can then operate(swap, duplicate, etc..) on cells and cells of nested lists as single items. Here is the previous list in memory, notice how the <code>&b</code> nested list has the extra piece of data <code>:list</code>, <code>:&e</code> and <code>:&c</code>:</p>

<pre>
@root
:list :nil :&a
	&a :cat :&b
	&b :list :&e :&c
		&c :dog :&d
		&d :bat :nil
	&e :ant :nil
</pre>
