<h2>Using stack effect definitions in Uxntal.</h2>

<p>The Uxntal notation follows that of the <a href='forth.html'>Forth</a>
programming language, where each item on the left of the <kbd>--</kbd> spacer
is the state of the stack before, and to the right, the state of the stack
after:</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b -- a b c )
	ADDk
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>By default, single items are a byte long, and shorts are indicated with a
<kbd>*</kbd> suffix, the order in which they appear is the order of the stack
with the top item to the right:</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b* -- b* a )
	ROT
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>In some rare cases, an item is passed to a routine via the return stack, in
this case it is prefixed with the <kbd>`</kbd> character indicates items in the
return stack to its right. The return address is omitted from the stack effect
notation.</p>

<pre>
@routine ( a* `b* -- )
	POP2 POP2r
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>If a specific item on the stack needs to be explicit about it being a pointer
that needs to be unquoted, the concatenative notation is written within square
brackets.</p>

<pre>
@routine ( {fn}* -- )
	JMP2
</pre>

<p>Further notation is available for <a href='uxntal_types.html'>program
verification</a>.</p>
