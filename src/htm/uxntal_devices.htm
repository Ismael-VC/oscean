<h2>Devices & Vectors</h2>

<img src="../media/generic/uxn.devices.png" width="300" style="float:right"/>

<p>Uxn can communicate with a maximum of 16 devices, each device has 16 ports, each port handles a specific I/O message. Ports are mapped to the devices memory page, which is located outside of the main addressable memory.</p>

<p>Uxn is non-interruptible, <b>vectors</b> are locations in programs that are evaluated when certain events occur. A vector is evaluated until a BRK opcode is encountered, no new events will be triggered while a vector is evaluated, but events may be queued. All programs begin by executing the <i>reset vector</i> located at <code>0x100</code>. Only one vector is executed at a time. The content of the stacks are preserved between vectors.</p>

<pre>
|0100

	<i>( set a vector )</i>
	;on-mouse .Mouse/vector DEO2

BRK

@on-mouse ( -> )

	<i>( read mouse state )</i>
	.Mouse/state DEI ?&on-touch BRK 

&on-touch ( -> )

	<i>( A mouse button was pressed )</i>

BRK
</pre>

<p>For example, the address stored in the <code>Mouse/vector</code> port points to a part of the program to be evaluated when the cursor is moved, or a button state has changed. </p>
