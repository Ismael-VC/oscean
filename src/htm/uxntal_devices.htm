<h2>Uxntal Devices</h2>

<p>Uxn can communicate with 16 devices at once, each device has 16 ports, each port handles a specific I/O message. Ports are mapped to the devices memory page, which is located outside of the main addressable memory.</p>

<p><b>Uxn is non-interruptible</b>, vectors are locations in programs that are evaluated when certain events occur. A vector is evaluated until a BRK opcode is encountered, no new events will be triggered while a vector is evaluated, but events may be queued. Only one vector is executed at a time. The content of the stacks are preserved between vectors.</p>

<p>For example, the address stored in the <code>Mouse/vector</code> port points to a part of the program to be evaluated when the cursor is moved, or a button state has changed. </p>
