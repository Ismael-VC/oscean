<h2>Avian Numerals</h2>

<p>Talking birds define numbers in terms of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding' target="_blank">number of times</a> a word is applied onto another, for example, one is the application of a word with a value once. Following on from that idea, zero is the application of a function, zero times. Zero and one are KI and I, respectively.</p>

<h3>Y combinator</h3>

<p>Applied to a function with one variable the Y combinator usually does not terminate. More interesting results are obtained by applying the Y combinator to functions of two or more variables. The second variable may be used as a counter, or index. The resulting function behaves like a while or a for loop in an imperative language.</p>

People learn such socially useless things as the names of birds and the grammar of dead languages because they are bored with the mind-dumbing options dished out to them on TV.

<h3>Arithmetic</h3>

true = K
false = KI
not = V false true = V(KI)K
implies = R true = RK
and = R false = R(KI)
or = T true = TK
equiv = CS not = CS(V(KI)K)
