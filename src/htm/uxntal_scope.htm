<h2>Using and defining scope in Uxntal.</h2>

<p>Uxntal objects are defined statically using a <kbd>@label</kbd> token, it allows for the enclosed methods to access local <kbd>&labels</kbd>. The example below creates an object with the method <kbd>get-x</kbd>, accessible from outside the scope as <kbd>Object/get-x</kbd>. By capitalizing the object name, we communicate to the assembler that the label will not be called and should not raise a warning.</p>

<pre>
@Object

&x $1 &y $1

&get-x <i>( -- x )</i>
	,&x LDR
	JMP2r
</pre>

<p>New methods and members can be appended to an existing scope by redeclaring the scope name followed by a slash and the name of the extension. The <kbd>&labels</kbd> declared within the extension have the same permissions for accessingle local labels as during the object definition. To learn more, see <a href='symbols.html'>symbols</a>.</p>

<pre>
@Object/get-y <i>( -- y )</i>
	,&y LDR
	JMP2r
</pre>
