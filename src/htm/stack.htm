<h2>Imagine that software development becomes so complex and expensive that no software is being written anymore, only apps designed in devtools.</h2>

	<p>Imagine a computer, which requires 1 billion transistors to flicker the cursor on the screen. Imagine a world, where computers are driven by software written from 400 million lines of source code.</p>
	<p>Imagine a world, where the biggest 20 technology corporation totaling 2 million employees and 100 billion USD revenue groups up to introduce a new standard. And they are unable to write even a compiler within 15 years.</p>
	<p>This is our current world.</p>

<p>In mainstream computing, <b>ease of use</b> is usually implemented as <i>superficial simplicity</i>, as an additional layer of complexity that hides the underlying layers. Meanwhile, systems that are actually very simple and elegant are often presented in ways that make them look complex to laypeople.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs supposedly claimed that he intended his personal computer to be a <i>bicycle for the mind</i> &mdash; But what he really sold us was a <i>train for the mind</i>, which goes only between where rails and stations have been laid down by armies of laborers.</p>

<q>Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.</q>

<p>I always told people that the thing computers are best at is adding unwanted complexity. If I am in a room full of computer professionals I think I am in a room full of people who mostly make their living dealing with computer fat. If you ask that room full of people what their companies do what will they say:</p>

<p>We sell software to clean up the garbage left behind by your programs. We sell software to deal with the growing complexity of your software. We just keep selling bigger upgrades to our product. We sell a bigger CPU. We sell bigger memories. We sell a service solving people's upgrade problems. We sell PCs to people who don't need them. <a href='http://www.ultratechnology.com/lowfat.htm' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<h3>The Cloud Is Just Someone Else's Computer</h3>

<p>A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didnâ€™t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.</p>

<q>The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair.</q>
