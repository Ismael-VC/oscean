<h2>I fought my way through a blizzard, on the request of a friend who
invited me over to witness the completion of a recent project.</h2>

<article>
	<p>I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very
well have been a time machine. A silhouetted shape across the dark room,
invites me to make my way through the unlit workshop and join them.</p>
	<p>Arched over a heap of what I first perceived to be a exposed innards of some
camera-like mechanism, my friend held a minuscule weight above an equally small
machined brass hand. After allowing only ever the briefest of time to settle
myself before the inscrutable contraption, they carefully lowered a pea-sized
weight onto the machine's opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm
emerged. Plucking a gear out from its own ticking body, the clasp gently swung
across and over itself to lay the cog down into a velveted box at its side.</p>
	<p>For each ascending counter-weight descended a ballet of tiny articulated
ratchets spun at the end of rotating arms. Little hammers knocked screws off,
pulleys pried pins out of their holes, each equally occupied at the business of
their own dismantlement. Screws, nuts, bolts, shims, and soon the fingers and
the ratchet themselves, joined the rest of the hardware in the cushioned cut
holes where each and every bit of the machine was expected to land.</p>
	<p>A single weight swayed, balanced at the end of the last tin rod, every other
thing already thrown in their place to rest. All but these two components
rested in the box, the equilibrium broke, the rod tilted toward the box; both
fell exhausted in their designated shapes.</p>
	<p>So, what do you think?</p>
