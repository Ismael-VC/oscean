<h2>I fought my way through a blizzard, on the request of a friend who
invited me over to witness the completion of a recent project.</h2>

<article>
	<p>I hung my snow-covered coat on something that might very well have been a
time machine. A silhouetted shape across the dark room, invites me through the
unlit workshop to join them.</p>
	<p>Arched over a heap of what I first perceived to be the exposed innards of some
camera-like mechanism, my friend held a minuscule weight above an equally small
machined brass hand. After allowing for a brief moment to settle myself before
the inscrutable contraption, a pea-sized weight was carefully lowered onto the
machine's beckoning palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged. Plucking
a gear out from its own ticking body, the clasp gently swung across and over
itself to lay the cog down into a velveted box at its side.</p>
	<p>For each ascending counter-weight descended a ballet of tiny articulated
ratchets spun at the end of rotating arms. Little hammers knocked screws off,
pulleys pried pins out of their holes, each equally occupied at the business of
their own dismantlement. Screws, nuts, bolts, shims, and soon the fingers and
the ratchet themselves, joined the rest of the hardware in the cushioned cut
holes where each and every bit of the machine was expected to land.</p>
	<p>A single weight swayed, balanced at the end of the last tin rod, the other parts
already resting in their proper place. All but these two components remained,
the equilibrium broke, the rod tilted toward the container; and finally, both
fell in their designated shapes.</p>
