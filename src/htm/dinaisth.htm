<h2>Dinaisth is the location onto which unfolds the events of the Neauismetica.</h2>

<p><b>Dinaisth</b> was periodically transformed and inhabited by multiple groups, each leaving traces of their visit in the form of tools, notes and artifacts. Its proximity to the <a href='ehrivevnv.html'>Ehrivevnv</a> megastructure, by which it is orbited, is the principal reason for which the earlier explorers landed on Dinaisth, its estimated position at the end of the universe's life is what brought the protagonists of the Neauismetica.</p>
