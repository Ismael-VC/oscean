<h2>Paradichlorisse is a being that emits Nohlxeserre speech.</h2>

<p>Living deep beneath the surface of the Es plains, Paradichlorisse can be found endlessly reciting a kind of <a href='nohlxeserre.html'>story</a>. On its ribbon-like body, one will find the story of the <a href='soies.html'>occuring moment</a>, as it occurs, in higher definition than presence itself.</p>

<p>A lesser impression of that encounter would be aking to picking up a book, and in vivid details, before your eyes is the story of your own picking up of that book, and the narration of the confusion that ensued.</p>

<p>An unfortunate traveler glancing at Paradichlorisse, would immediately collapse, unable to pull away. The naration of the current moment would feel more real than existence itself, and they would not find their way back into their enactable part of that story.</p>

<p><i>When Paradichlorisse spoke of silence, silence fell.</i></p>
<q>It is because I cannot see what you see that I can see at all.</q>
