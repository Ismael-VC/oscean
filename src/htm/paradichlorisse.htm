<h2>Paradichlorisse is a being that emits Nohlxeserre speech.</h2>

<p>Living deep beneath the surface of the <a href='es.html'>Es plains</a>, snaking through and across <a href='dinaisth.html'>Dinaisth</a>, Paradichlorisse's ribbon-like body is adorned with a kind of <a href='nohlxeserre.html'>story</a> of the <a href='soies.html'>occurring moment</a>, as it occurs, in higher definition than presence itself.</p>

<p>A lesser impression of an encounter with Paradichlorisse would be akin to picking up a book, and in vivid details, before your eyes is the story of your own picking up of that book, and the narration of the confusion that ensued.</p>

<p>An unfortunate traveler glancing at Paradichlorisse, would immediately collapse, unable to pull away. The narration of the current moment would feel more real than existence itself, and they would not find their way back into their enactable part of that story.</p>

<p><i>When Paradichlorisse spoke of silence, silence fell.</i></p>

<q>It is because I cannot see what you see that I can see at all.</q>
