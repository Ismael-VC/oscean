<p>The <i>Neon Hermetists</i> were the last inhabitants of <a href='dinaisth.html'>Dinaisth</a>, and the ones who operated the machines that crafted this ultimate final and long-lasting occurance. By the arrival of <a href='neonev.html'>Neonev</a> on the planet, the work of <i>Science</i> had long since <a href='feu.html'>ended</a>, replaced by the art of operating <a href='actors.html'>teleogic constructors</a>, machines capable of looking across different simultaneous timelines and moving themselves toward the <a href='soies.html'>longest lasting</a> end.</p>

<q>A horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look at the horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits vision, for the horizon opens onto all that lies beyond itself. What limits vision is rather the incompleteness of that vision.</q>
