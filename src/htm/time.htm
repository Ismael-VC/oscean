<h2>A place that no mortal can ever reach.</h2>

<p>Every day shift is followed by a night shift, and every night shift by a day
shift, so neither will ever get the final word. The real course of immutable
history which we all share, then, must be the limit of an infinite number of
changes. The history that we all share is the final word once all the work has
been done.</p>

<p>Since there will always have been a finite number of human generations
following the construction of the first time machine, and since the men of each
generation will only work a finite number of shifts during their lives, humans
will never be able to write the last of an infinite number of changes. If the
last word cannot be had by any mortal, then it must be had by some supernatural
entity. It is the thesis of the present interpretation that the final course of
history is determined by the will of God. <a
