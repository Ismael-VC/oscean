<h2>The devlog is a collection of design notes.</h2>

<p>Below are the disjointed thoughts on the creation of a <a href='varvara.html'>clean-slate computing stack</a> based on a <a href='uxn.html'>minimal virtual machine</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Part 1</b>: <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>A virtual machine</a></li>
	<li><b>Part 2</b>: <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>A personal computer</a></li>
	<li><b>Part 3</b>: An operating system</li>
</ul>

<p>As opposed to the seemingly natural trend in software, Uxn is reaching backward in time and making itself available further and further back in time(1987), growing increasingly smaller(1kb). I keep on circling back to paper computers, and how much I want a machine such that even if people took computers away from me, a piece of paper could serve as a viable host in its stead.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>The realization of this project is largely due to the work of the community, with special thanks to Andy Alderwick, Sigrid Solveig Haflínudóttir, Andrew Richards, and everyone else who contributed ideas and shared their knowledge with me, without whom Uxn could not have become what it is now. Nearly a year after its initial draft, <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>a lot of uxn code</a> has been written. In fact, this text has been written in <a href='left.html'>Left</a>, a text-editor hosted on this strangely personal computer, and this <a href='about.html'>wiki</a> was also built by it.</p>
