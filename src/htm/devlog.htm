<h2>The devlog is a collection of design notes.</h2>

<p>Below are disjointed thoughts on the creation of a <a href='varvara.html'>clean-slate computing stack</a> based on the <a href='uxn.html'>universal virtual machine</a> strategy for digital preservation. As opposed to the seemingly natural trend in software, Uxn is reaching backward in time and making itself available further and further back in time, growing increasingly smaller.</p>

	<li><b>Part 2</b>: <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>A personal computer</a></li>
	<li><b>Part 3</b>: An operating system</li>

<p>The realization of this project is largely due to the work of the community, with special thanks to Andy Alderwick, Sigrid Solveig Haflínudóttir, Andrew Richards, and everyone else who contributed ideas and shared their knowledge with me, without whom Uxn could not have become what it is now. Nearly a year after its initial draft, <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>a lot of uxn code</a> has been written. In fact, this text has been written in <a href='left.html'>Left</a>, a text-editor hosted on this strangely personal computer, and this <a href='about.html'>wiki</a> was also generated by it.</p>
