<h2>Uxntal Memory</h2>

<p>There are 64kb of addressable memory. Roms are loaded at 0x0100, which is the
address of the <a href='uxntal_devices.html'>reset vector</a>. Once in memory,
a Uxn program can write over itself, store values among its running code, it is
not uncommon for a uxntal program to <a href='uxntal_state.html'>directly
modify</a> a value in memory. When writing or reading a short in
memory, the position is that of the high byte.</p>

<pre>
#12 #0200 STA <span style='float:right'>0x0200=12</span>
#3456 #0400 STA2 <span style='float:right'>0x0400=34, 0x0401=56</span>
#0400 LDA2 <span style='float:right'>34 56</span>
</pre>

<p>The zero-page is the memory located between 0x0000 and 0x0100, its purpose is
to store variables that will be accessed often. It is sligthly faster to read
and write from the zero-page using the LDZ and STZ opcodes as they use only a
single byte instead of a short. Some emulators support soft-reboot which
preserves the content of the zero-page during a reboot. This memory space
cannot be pre-filled in the rom prior to assembly.</p>

<pre>
#1234 #80 STZ2 <span style='float:right'>0x0080=12, 0x0081=34</span>
#80 LDZ2 <span style='float:right'>12 34</span>
