<h2>Oscean is a flat-file wiki engine.</h2>

<p><b>Oscean</b> is a static wiki engine written entirely in <a href='uxntal.html'>assembly</a>, designed to be deployed from <a href='permacomputing.html'>low-power devices</a> with no extra dependencies. The engine has grown into a collection of tools which also includes a <a href='horaire.html'>time tracker</a>.</p>
<p>The wiki and related tools are designed to be used <a href='about.html'>offline first</a>, so the content is generally accessed and edited locally, there are no offsite queries for critical resources.</p>
<p>The generated files are optimized for screen-readers and terminal browsers, using no javascript, the stylesheet for this entire website is 30 lines long. The entire project was designed with a focus on <a href='solarpunk.html'>resilience</a> and <a href='longtermism.html'>longtermism</a>. </p>
