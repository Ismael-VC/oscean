<h2>Oscean is a wiki engine.</h2>

<p><b>Oscean</b> is written entirely in <a href='uxntal.html'>assembly</a> and designed to be deployed from <a href='permacomputing.html'>low-power devices</a> by doing away with any dependencies beyond the thin emulation layer of the <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn virtual machine</a>. The static site generator is compiled with the <a href='drifblim.html'>drifblim assembler</a> which is self-hosted, meaning that it is written in the language that it assembles.</p>

<p>The generated files are optimized for screen-readers and terminal browsers, using no javascript, and a stylesheet of a mere 30 lines. The wiki and its related tools are generally used <a href='about.html'>offline</a>, so there are no offsite queries for critical resources. Since 2006, this ecosystem has grown into a collection of tools which also includes a <a href='horaire.html'>time tracker</a>. The journal entries are catalogued in the <a href='arvelie.html'>Arvelie</a> time format.</p>
