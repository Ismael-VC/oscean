<h2>A second-order reversible cellular automata with four states.</h2>

<p>Stable gliders are three-cell "ants" moving in vertical and horizontal directions with unit speed with reflections, collisions and splitting. Unlike <a href='wireworld.html'>wireworld</a>, the ants can be used for construction of different kinds of "wireless circuits."</p>

<p>There are four states: 0 (empty, white), 1 (red), 2 (green), 3 (blue).</p>

<ul>
	<li>A cell with state 0 or 2 (white or green) is called "even"</li>
	<li>and a cell with state 1 or 3 (red or blue) is called "odd"</li>
</ul>

<p>A step may be divided into two stages:</p>

<pre>First stage:
Mark all cells satisfying two conditions:
(1) total number of odd cells in four closest positions (up, down, left, right) is one or two,
(2) cells in four diagonal positions are even.</pre>

<pre>Second stage:
For unmarked: exchange red and green cells (1<->2).
For marked cells: change empty into red, red into blue, blue into green,
green into empty (0->1->3->2->0).</pre>
