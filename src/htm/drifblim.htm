<h2>Drifblim is a Uxntal assembler, written in Uxntal.</h2>

<p>The assembler is written in <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> itself, it's designed to be distributed as a rom to help bootstrap the uxn ecosystem. The goal for Driflim is to have its raw hex codes available on a single piece of paper, along with its source, and a monochromatic picture where each pixel represents a bit.</p>

<p>It is meant to be as small as it could possibly be made. The goal would be for it to be in the 1kb range. It will not support macros or includes. Instead, a pre-processor rom might be considered.</p>

<p>Since this assembler is written in the language it is assembling, it creates a chicken-and-egg problem. You have two choices, download a pre-assembled <a href='https://rabbits.srht.site/drifblim/drifblim.rom' target="_blank">drifblim.rom</a>(1.2kb), or use <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/main/item/src/uxnasm.c' target="_blank">uxnasm.c</a>. </p>

<p><i>Drifblim is strong enough to lift Pok√©mon or people but has no control over its flight. This causes it to drift with the wind and end up anywhere.</i></p>
