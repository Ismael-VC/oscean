<h2>Drifblim is a Uxntal assembler.</h2>

<p>The assembler is written in <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> itself, it's designed to be distributed as a rom to help bootstrap a uxn ecosystem. The goal would be to have its raw hex codes printed on a single piece of paper, it should also be available as a monochromatic picture where each pixel is a bit. It might be important or not to also generate the symbols file from the assembler, the option is available to do so in the respository.</p>

<p>Drifblim is strong enough to lift Pok√©mon or people but has no control over its flight. This causes it to drift with the wind and end up anywhere.</p>
