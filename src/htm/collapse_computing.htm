<h2>Taking advantage of today's abundance in computing power to prepare for a
future in which infrastructures have collapsed.</h2>

<p><b>Designing for Descent</b> ensures that a system is resilient to
intermittent energy supply and network connectivity. Collapse informatics
prioritizes community needs and aims to contribute to a knowledge commons in
order to be able to succeed in case of <a href='collapse.html'>infrastructure
collapse</a>. The practice of engaging with the discarded with an eye to
transforming what is exhausted and wasted into renewed resources.</p>

<p>Nothing new needs producing and no e-waste needs processing. If your new
software no longer runs on old hardware, it is <a
href='obsolescence.html'>worse</a> than the old software. Software should
function on existing hardware and rely on modularity in order to enable a
diversity of combinations and implementations. It is about reinventing
essential tools so that they are accessible, scalable, sturdy, modular, easy to
repair and well documented.</p>

<p>A post-collapse society that has eventually lost all of its artificial
computing capacity may still want to continue the practice of computer science
in a purely theoretical level, as a form of mathematics.</p>

<q>And one voice, with sublime disregard for the situation, read poetry aloud in
the firey study, until all the film spools burned, until all the wires withered
and the circuits cracked.</q>
