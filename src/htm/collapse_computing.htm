<h2>Collapse informatics is software engineering taking advantage of today's abundance in computing power to prepare for a future in which current infrastructures have collapsed.</h2>

<p>It is based on decentralisation, not only because current centralised services and networks will <a href='stack.html'>break down</a>, but also because peer-to-peer infrastructures are more resilient and flexible. It aims for simplicity, software should function on existing hardware and rely on modularity in order to enable a diversity of combinations and implementations. </p>

<p>Systems need to be resilient to intermittent energy supply and network connectivity. Collapse informatics prioritizes community needs and make use of open-source licenses to contribute to a knowledge commons in order to be able to succeed in case of <a href='collapse.html'>economic collapse</a>. The practice of engaging with the discarded with an eye to transforming what is exhausted and wasted into renewed resources.</p>

<p>A post-collapse society that has eventually lost all of its artificial computing capacity may still want to continue the practice of computer science in a purely theoretical level, as a form of mathematics.</p>

<p>Nothing new needs producing and no e-waste needs processing. If your new software no longer runs on old hardware, it is <a href='obsolescence.html'>worse</a> than the old software.</p>
