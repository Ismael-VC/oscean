<h2>A personal computer</h2>

<p>What are computers for, anyway?</p>

<p>Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention. I think of computers like you would a telescope, but to observe immaterial objects. Mathematical beauty is the aesthetic pleasure derived from the abstractness, or orderliness of mathematics. Similarly to how one might enjoy spending time studying venation patterns, we can imagine a device to explore procedural music and parametric illustration.</p>

<p>This romantic vision of the liddite, potentially emancipating, power of computing was prompty squelched by military drones, surveillance hardware and the advertisement machinery. Suffice to say, that nowadays, to most of my friends, computing evokes either encroaching social networks or the drugery of data entry.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm making it more diffult than necessary by using the term <i>personal computer</i>, and not finding a more capable word to describe what I have in mind.</p>

<p>I am certain that making something unique by way of customization is necessary for care, <i>for when the unique breaks, </i><a href='https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/that-which-is-unique-breaks' target='_blank'>we might mend</a>. I often think back on how, in the movie Hackers(1995), each character had their own laptop launch sequence reflecting parts of their aesthetics. A far cry from the NodeJS hexagonal stickers found on every second laptop today.</p>

<h3>I. Drawing</h3>

<p>I heard tales from the fabled era of computing when people would create simple operating systems over the course of a weekend or two, it inspired me to try and find the building blocks needed to make this process more approachable. But first, <b>a pixel</b>, from it various lines, letters, shapes and other primitives can be derived.</p>

<p>One of the many things that <a href='plan9.html'>Plan 9</a> has made quite clear to me, was that interface design can be fun. An easy access to a pixel buffer makes all the difference to fostering an ecosystem of personalized applications. </p>

<p>The Famicom's picture processing unit uses little 8x8 tiles, which fit neatly in 8 bytes of memory, where each byte is a row, and each monochromatic pixel is a bit. This tile size is small enough that someone with a pen and paper could mentally decypher its content, and large enough to contain a letter or a pictogram.</p>

<p>The Neo Geo's graphics processor assembles tiles into larger sprites by drawing them in a sequence, either vertically or horizontally. We can easily draw a 2x2 picture by adding an extra drawing message to the screen device.</p>

<p>Varvara's screen device allows for drawing larger real-time graphics with very little boilerplate that could get in the way of creating interfaces and assets.</p>
