<h2>Graphical input is concerned about communicating with the computer in a
visual language.</h2>

<p>In the 1960s, Gabriel Groner wrote a program which recognized handprinted
letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and geometric figures. A user communicates
with the computer via writing on a tablet with a pen, pressing it against the
 writing surface. </p>

<p>The decoding scheme smoothes the stroke by averaging a newly arrived point
with the previously smoothed point. Next, thinning removes some of the points
from the pen stroke by comparing the latest position with the position of the
previous point in the thinned track. By detecting changes in the direction of
the points in the path we have sufficient description for recognition.</p>

<h3>Palm Graffiti</h3>

<p>Graffiti is a single-stroke shorthand handwriting recognition system used in
PDAs based on the Palm OS in which the user cannot see their stroke. The
software is based primarily on a neography of upper-case characters that can be
drawn blindly with a stylus on a touch-sensitive panel.</p>
