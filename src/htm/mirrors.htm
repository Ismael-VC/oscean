<p>Morals refer mainly to guiding principles, and <a href='ethics.html'>ethics</a> refer to specific rules and actions, or behaviors. A moral precept is an idea or opinion that's driven by a desire to be good. An ethical code is a set of rules that defines allowable actions or correct behavior.</p>
<q>Mystery exists in the mind, not in reality. <br />Confusion exists in the <a href='simulacra.html'>map</a>, not in the territory.</q>
