<h2>Despite being from there, Canada has become a travel destination to me.</h2>

<p>After spending 49 days at sea, sailing from <a
href='shimoda.html'>Shimoda</a>(Japan), we returned in Victoria(Canada),
effectively completing a 5 years circumnavigation of the <a
href='marquesas.html'>Pacific Ocean</a>, via <a href='new_zealand.html'>New
Zealand</a>.</p>

<p>We have sailed north from British Columbia to <a href='alaska.html'>Alaska</a>.</p>

<q>There was not a single prospect that was pleasing to the eye.</q>
