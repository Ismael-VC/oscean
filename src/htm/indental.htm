<h2>Indental is a plaintext dictionary-type database format designed to store elements accessible by name.</h2>

<p>In the Indental file, an unindented line declares the key to a new root node, indented lines associate parameters or lists to their root node, a key-value pair is declared with a colon, and a list is declared by a sequence of equally indented lines.</p>

<pre>
NAME
	KEY &#58; VALUE
	LIST
		ITEM1
		ITEM2
</pre>

<p>Or, <code>&#123;NAME:&#123;KEY:VALUE,LIST:[ITEM1,ITEM2])&#125;</code></p>

<p>This database format was used to store the plain-text content of the <a href='oscean.html'>Oscean</a> wiki between 2014 and 2020. </p>
