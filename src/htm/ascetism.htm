<p>One must first place oneself from the point of view of Epicurus and distinguish natural from imaginary needs. When we are able to despise in practice all that is unnecessary to life, when we will disdain luxury and comfort, when we will savor the physical pleasure that come from simple <a href='nutrition.html'>food and drink</a>.</p>

<p>The philosopher Diogenes was eating bread and lentils for supper. He was seen by the philosopher Aristippus, who lived comfortably by flattering the king.<br />
Said Aristippus, 'If you would learn to be subservient to the king you would not have to live on lentils.'<br />
Said Diogenes, 'Learn to live on lentils and you will not have to be subservient to the king'</p>
