    <p>A horizon is a phenomenon of vision. One cannot look at the horizon; it is simply the point beyond which we cannot see. There is nothing in the horizon itself, however, that limits vision, for the horizon opens onto all that lies beyond itself. What limits vision is rather the incompleteness of that vision.</p>

    <p>One never reaches a horizon. It is not a line; it has no place; it encloses no field; its location is always relative to the view. We are never somewhere in relation to the horizon since the horizon moves with our vision.</p>
