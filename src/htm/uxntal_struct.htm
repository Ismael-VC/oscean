<h2>Structs allow to access individual members in a data structure.</h2>

<p>Structs are defined by rolling back the program address with <kbd>|00</kbd>, similarly to how you would define an enum.</p>

<pre>
|00 @person &name $2 &age $1 &height $2 &length
</pre>

<p>The <code>length</code> member of the struct holds the total size of the struct, and allows to jump to a specific item in a datastructure.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The idea here is that you define padded labels, for example the <code>;person/age</code> label holds the value of <code>$0002</code>, naming that offset allows to access specific members of a data structure by applying the sublabels of the enum to a pointer.</p>

<pre>
|0100 @reset

	( get second person ) ;family #0001 ;person/length MUL2 ADD2
		( get name* ) DUP2 ;person/name ADD2 LDA2 ;pstr JSR2
		( get age ) DUP2 ;person/age ADD2 LDA ;phex/byte JSR2
		( get height* ) ;person/height ADD2 LDA2 ;phex JSR2
