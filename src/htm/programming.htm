<h2>A collection of notes on programming languages.</h2>

<p>We use software because we have goals to achieve and things to do. The software we use is coded by programmers who have their own goals, sometimes these goals overlap with ours, over time these will diverge. The tools we depend on grow features we don't use or understand, introducing bugs that will prevent us from reaching our goals.</p>

<p>We have the choice of trying to understand the code and fix it, we have the choice of trying another program, and we have the choice of coding the software ourselves. All but the last path mean <a href='stack.html'>endless seeking</a>, evaluating and further deviation from our goals. </p>

<h3>code it yourself manifesto</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We implement it according to our own goals.</li>
	<li>We make mistakes and learn from them.</li>
	<li>We learn how the tools we depend on need to work.</li>
	<li>We gain a deep understanding of our problem domain.</li>
	<li>We still embrace sharing of ideas and code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Software freedom is the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose, to study how the program works, and change it, to redistribute copies and your modified versions so you can help others.</p>

<q>The concept that programming is something that you need special education to do is not right. It is something that is promoted by the priesthood.</q>
