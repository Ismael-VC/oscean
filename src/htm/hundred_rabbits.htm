<h2>Open-source software and technological resilience research, aboard a sailboat.</h2>

<p>Hundred Rabbits is a <a href='nonprofit.html'>nonprofit organization</a> exploring the planned failability of <a href='technology.html'>modern technology</a> at the bounds of the hyper-connected world. We explore <a href='permacomputing.html'>low-tech solutions</a> and document our findings with the hope of building a more resilient future. </p>

<p>We live and work on a 10 meters vessel called <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, we have sailed around the Pacific Ocean and realized how fragile the modern-day <a href='stack.html'>computing stack</a> was. Living in remote uninhabited parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>

<p>The name <i>Hundred Rabbits</i> comes from the name of the sailboat in the animated show <a href='https://ergoproxy.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Calm_(Busy_Doing_Nothing)' target='_blank'>Ergo proxy</a>, while the sailboat's name Pino</i> comes from the android sailor aboard the sailboat from that same show.</p>

<p>This partnership is host to creative interactive projects like <a href='oquonie.html'>oquonie</a>, <a href='grimgrains.html'>grimgrains</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzdg4pZb-viC3EdA1zxRl4A?view_as=subscriber' target='_blank'>travel diaries</a>.</p>
