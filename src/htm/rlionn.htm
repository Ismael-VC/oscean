<h2>Rlionn is a being who periodically manifest itself on Laeisth.</h2>

<p>Rlionn is not a single individual but a trait that manifests itself in the travelers who wander near the Oasis of <a href='laeisth.html'>Laeisth</a>. It is experienced as a sort of lucid dream that drives its hosts to embark on walks across the desert toward <a href='paradichlorisse.html'>Paradichlorisse</a>.</p>

<p>During that trance, one becomes a vessel for Rlionn to physically interact with the world of Dinaisth, and inversely, the afflicted  has momentary control over the dream world from which Rlionn originates.</p>

<p>Spoken-of in tales and songs, the stories of Rlionn and the procession of its subjects are sung in the album <a href='children_of_bramble.html'>Children Of Bramble</a>. Rlionn's reach does not extend beyond the shores of the Laeisth continent, and so Rlionn never effectively reach its destination, it only leaves stranded and confused sleepwalkers in the wastes.</p>
