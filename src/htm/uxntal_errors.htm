<h2 id='errors'>Errors</h2>

<p>Errors occur when a program behaves unexpectedly. Errors are normally handled by the emulator, but programs can set a system vector to evaluate when errors occurs. There are three known error types, and each one has an error code:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>01</code> <b>Underflow</b>: Occurs when an opcode is trying to pop an item from an empty stack.</li>
	<li><code>02</code> <b>Overflow</b>: Occurs when an opcode is trying to push an item to a full stack.</li>
	<li><code>03</code> <b>Division By Zero</b>: Occurs when the DIV opcode is done on a value of zero.</li>
</ul>
