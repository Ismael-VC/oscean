<h2>The Studio equipment.</h2>

<p>While the <a href='aliceffekt.html'>aliceffekt</a> sounds were mostly sampled from the <a href='https://www.arturia.com/microbrute/overview' target='_blank'>Microbrute</a>, the <a href='alicef.html'>alicef</a> sounds came from the <a href='https://www.eltamusic.com/polivoks-mini' target='_blank'>Поливокс</a>.</p>

<h3>Routing</h3>
<p>I typically record albums using one of the two synths, I built a library of samples over the years which I use for live shows so I don't have to carry the synths along with me.</p>
<p>When I'm experimenting, I will often have <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> running on a computer, or a midi controller going into the <a href='norns.html'>Norns</a>(which I use for automating arpeggios and midi effects) connected into the Polivoks or Microbrute, which is connected to the Infinite Jets.</p>
<p>I don't use any type of midi syncing, I try to manually tune the LFOs and delays to play well with the instrumentation but I don't have any way of sending midi clocks between the various devices, I found that this typically adds a sort of organicity to otherwise very rigid tracks.</p>
