<h2>Graf3DScene is a 3D wireframe toolkit for Macintosh.</h2>

<p>Graf3DScene is a small collection of scripts to create scenes in <a href='pascal.html'>Pascal</a> on the <a href='macintosh.html'>Macintosh</a>. This companion to <a href='nasu.html'>Nasu</a> was designed to help create rich 1-bit graphics, and is currently utilized to create the scenery of the <a href='neauismetica.html'>Neauismetica</a>. It has been superseeded by <a href='moogle.html'>Moogle</a>.</p>

	<li><code>Graf3DPrimitives.p</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The unit contains procedures to create a scene, an orbit camera, and a collection of tools to assemble custom 3D shapes from verticles, edges and faces.</p>

<p>It was built and tested on THINK Pascal 4.0.2, on System 7.1, and requires the Graf3D and the FixedMath units & libraries(which typically comes with THINK Pascal). If you're missing the necessary libraries, contact me and I will send you a disk.</p>
