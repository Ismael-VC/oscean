<h2>Types are a way to suggest or restrict the activities possible for an object of that type.</h2>

<p>A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Type inference refers to the automatic detection of the type of an expression.</p>

<p>Weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a string as a number. Strong typing raises an error on attempts to perform an operation on the wrong type of value.</p>
