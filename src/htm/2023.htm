	<h2>2023-02-24 Oquonie is nearly ready</h2>
	<p>The weather has been absolute garbage these past few days and so has been a great help in completing the Oquonie port. Not only is the project pushing Uxn further than I previously ventured, it is equally pushing the tools used in its creation, to their limits. The building of Oquonie has had me do some significant improvements to <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnlin' target='_blank'>Uxnlin</a>, and <a href='left.html'>Left</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It looks like Oquonie will make its way onto the <a href='playdate.html'>Playdate</a>.</li>
		<li>Played a set at the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5mBG1hlDQU' target='_blank'>Lovebyte Party</a>.</li>
		<li>Added a REPL mode to <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>.</li>

	<h2>2023-02-07 Oquonie is happening!</h2>
	<p>After putting together a tech demo of what a <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a> implementation of <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> could look like, Rekka and I decided to officially port it. It is a lot of fun to revisit this little universe again. I can't believe how much progress we've done in just a few days, at this rate it will be playable within the month.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Spared some time to fix a handful of issues in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy/' target='_blank'>Orca</a>.</li>

	<h2>2023-01-20 Function Stacks</h2>
	<p>I am unable to shake the wanting to play with <a href='reversible_computing.html'>reversible computing</a>, so I went ahead and put together a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/psi-forth' target='_blank'>simple project</a> that will allow me to experiment with the ideas of <a href='../docs/psi_lisp.html'>psi-lisp</a>. Somehow, this makes me feel like I'm visiting <a href='the_sartre_mechanism.html'>an old friend</a>.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, I've been trying to bring <a href='potato.html'>potato</a> to a usable state, which means that for it to entirely replace the current launcher, it should be able to assemble and run the assembled rom, a state to which I am inching closer.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Finally found a use for the 3 unused <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>uxn opcodes</a>.</li>
		<li>Rewrote the <a href='../etc/uxnrepl/index.html'>javascript REPL</a> implementation.</li>
		<li>Could I possibly port <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a>, to Uxntal?</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2023-01-08 Pino Rewiring</h2>
	<p>Since the turn of the year, we have spent every waking hour <a href='http://100r.co/site/electrical_refit.html' target='_blank'>rewiring Pino</a>, it has been a more challenging project than we had hoped but we will sleep soundly knowing that each connection has been well made.</p>
	<p>I've read Koopman's <a href='https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers' target='_blank'>Stack Machines: The New Wave</a> and it inspired me to experiment with other virtual machine designs, namely that of the NOVIX NC4016. But after two weeks of experiments, I returned to writing Uxntal, partly because I do not feel limited in the realization of my ideas with my current stack, and partly because these sort of systems make for extremely obfuscated assembly languages. That being said, I can't seem to shake the craving to experiment with the <a href='../docs/dssp.txt'>Setun-70</a>..</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chose a new <a href='metadata.html'>metadata</a> format and implemented it.</li>
