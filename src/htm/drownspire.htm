<h2>Drownspire was a small studio run in collaboration with Rekka between 2010 to 2012.</h2>

<p>We designed, produced and sold art projects. We made art toys, jewlery, apparel and sold tickets for chiptune shows in Montreal.</p>
<p>We closed the studio after we decided to move to Tokyo. Drownspire was the precursor to <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a>. We distributed the <a href='vambits.html'>Vambits</a> designer toys and published the <a href='merure.html'>Merure</a> books.</p>
