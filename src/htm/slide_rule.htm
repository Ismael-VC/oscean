<h2>The slide rule is a mechanical analog computer.</h2>

<p>The rulers each have a logarithmic scale(the spacing between the lines on the scale become smaller as the value increases), it is possible to align them to read the sum of the numbers' logarithms, and hence calculate the product of the two numbers. </p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Black scales</b>(A, B, C, D, K, etc.) increase from left to right.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>C & D scales are single (1-10) scales.</li>
		<li>A & B scales are double (1-10-100) having two cycles</li>
		<li>K is triple (1-10-100-1000) having three cycles</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Red scales</b>(CI, DI) increase from right to left.</li>
</ul>
