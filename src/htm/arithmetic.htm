<h2>Arithmetics is the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations on them.</h2>

<p>Some mathematicians are of the opinion that the doing of mathematics is closer to discovery than invention.</p>

	<p>Don't interrupt, Bruno said as we came in. I'm counting the Pigs in the field!<br />
How many are there? I enquired.<br />
About a thousand and four, said Bruno.<br />
You mean <i>about a thousand</i>, Sylvie corrected him. There's no good saying "and four": you can't be sure about the four!<br />
And you're as wrong as ever! Bruno exclaimed triumphantly. It's just the four I can be sure about; cause they're here, grubbing under the window! It is the thousand I isn't pruffickly sure about</p>

<p>The number 210, a primorial, is the smallest number divisible by the smallest 4 primes (2, 3, 5, 7) and has 16 divisors (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210).</p>

<h3>Greatest Common Divisor</h3>

<p>A divisor of two positive integers that is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without remainder. It is useful for reducing <a href='fractions.html'>fractions</a> to be in its lowest terms. You can find the GCD by performing repeated division starting from the two numbers we want to find the GCD of until we get a remainder of 0.</p>

<ul>
	<li>64 ÷ <b>40</b> = 1 with a remainder of <b>24</b></li>
	<li><b>40</b> ÷ <b>24</b> = 1 with a remainder of <b>16</b></li>
	<li><b>24</b> ÷ <b>16</b> = 1 with a remainder of <b>8</b></li>
	<li><b>16</b> ÷ <b>8</b> = 2 with a remainder of 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>We stop here since we've already got a remainder of 0. The last number we used to divide is 8 so the GCD of 40 and 64 is 8.</p>

<h3>Least Common Multiple</h3>

<p>A multiple of two integers that is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For two positive integers, the properties of their GCD and LCM come in pairs; the phenomenon is explained by the formula gcd(a, b) × lcm(a, b) = a × b.</p>
