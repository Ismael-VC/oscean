<h2>The Soies is the study of unexisting events.</h2>

<p>By forcing the nearest potential events to occur, a Teleogic Constructor can begin consuming <i>persistence</i> outside of the current chain of events and steer itself across the courses of time.</p>

<p>A <a href='soies_machine.html'>Soies machine</a> finds its own location according to the <a href='longest_end.html'>Longest End</a>, by generating small events happening at near-disallowed speed.</p>

<p>This line of research was tied to the discovery of the <a href='ehrivevnv.html'>Ehrivevnv</a>, considered to be a <a href='soies_injection.html'>Soies injection</a>, an artificial event that was forced to have happened, fabricated outside of the occurring timeline.</p>
