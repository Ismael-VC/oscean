<h2>The Neauismetica is a series of illustrated vignettes from Dinaisth.</h2>

<p>These tales unfold on a minuscule celestial object, on which three Immortals dwell. Originally written in French, "<b>Les Récits De Dinaisth</b>" begins when most things have ended, on the surface of a Satellite drifting in <i>lightless space</i>.</p>

<p>This series of disjointed <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>concepts</a>, <a href='characters.html'>characters</a> and <a href='dinaisth.html'>places</a> are the connecting thread that lives through <a href='aliceffekt.html'>aliceffekt</a>'s music, <a href='devine_lu_linvega.html'>Devine</a>'s <a href='illustration.html'>illustrations</a>, and are the culture behind the <a href='lietal.html'>lietal</a> Language.</p>

<q>Immortals speak not with words, but wait for things to happen, and merely point at them.</q>
