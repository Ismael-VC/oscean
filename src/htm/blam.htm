<h2>Blam is an improvisational album created as a live performance, that ultimately fell through.</h2>

<p>This album is the precursor to <a href='damoiseau_canalx.html'>damoiseau_canalx</a>, it was never performed live as it was intended, but recorded later in the car ride back.</p>
<p>The story behind the reason for why it was never performed will be for another time..</p>
