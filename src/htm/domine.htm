<h2>Domine is a 2-players domino game.</h2>

<p>The goal is to have the most “living” dominoes at the end of the round. </p>


<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Each player draws a hand of seven dominoes and keeps them hidden from their opponent. The two numbers on either side of a domino are the <i>Attack</i> and <i>Defense</i> points, facing the opponent and the player respectively. The dominoes can be flipped as long as it’s before they are played. Each turn consists choosing which is the attack side and which is the defense side. Players alternate turns until all dominoes have been played. The player with the most living dominoes wins.</p>

<p>When a player attacks with a domino, the opponent must defend with a value equal to or higher than the attack. If the opponent’s domino defense value is lower than the attack, the domino is killed. If the opponent’s domino defense value is equal to or higher, then the domino survives.</p>
