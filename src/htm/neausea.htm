<h2>The Neausea is a sickness that manifests when one knows their relative
position in time.</h2>

<p>To the afflicted, the experience of <b>Neausea</b>, would at first seems like
one can travel through time. But the subject's impression of time-traveling is
only their focus shifting across alternative possible sequences of
events.</p>

<p>To an observer, an afflicted would appear to suddently collapse, by the time
the body would hit the ground, the subject's mental gaze would have traveled
across valid possible timelines, but would have in the process <i>lost the
track of Time</i> &mdash; Effectively transforming, from a participant, into a mere
witness of the course of time.</p>
