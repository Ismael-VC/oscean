<h2>Church Numerals are a representation of the natural numbers using lambda
notation.</h2>

<p>Base-1 arithmetic in <a href='lisp.html'>Pure Lisp</a> uses only cons, car,
cdr, if, null?, lambdas and quote for the restricted purpose of quoting the
empty list. This document will present Church Numerals through the lens of
Lisp, alternatively one might prefer to read it coming from the <a
href='ornithomicon.html'>Avian Numerals</a> tutorial.</p>
