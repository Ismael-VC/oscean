<h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from
permaculture.</h2>

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion
in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements
for computing even the most trivial tasks. Permacomputing aims at only using
computing when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems, it's about
<b>articulating the value of absence</b>.</p>

<p>Permacomputing does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite
advocating a dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human
ingenuity to finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions,
competition into co-operation, and <a href='solarpunk.html'>waste into
resources</a></p>

<p>It values maintenance and encourages the refactoring of systems to keep them
efficient, instead of counting on Moore's law to compensate for <a
href='stack.html'>bloat</a>. Instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned
obsolescence</a>, permacomputing practices <a
href='http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html' target='_blank'>planned
longevity</a>, reuse and repair of existing technology.</p>

<p>Computation in this context is intrinsically <b>self-obviating</b>, which is to mean
that the computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less
necessary to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to
provide for their own welfare.</p>

<p>There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs,
advised by the concepts of permacomputing, and personalized systems to address
those needs, but there are no permacomputing products. Permacomputing is
concerned about finding these limits, and <b>not their artifacts</b>.</p>

<q>Asking for the most suitable programming language for permacomputing is akin
to asking for the most suitable plant for permaculture &mdash; the entire
question contradicts itself.</q>
