<h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from permaculture.</h2>

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements for computing even the most trivial tasks. Permacomputing aims at only using computing when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems.</p>

<p>Permacomputing does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating a dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenunity to finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition into co-operation, and <a href='solarpunk.html'>waste into resources</a></p>

<p>It values maintenance and encourages programmers to refactor and rewrite programs to keep them efficient, instead of counting on Moore's law to compensate for <a href='stack.html'>software bloat</a>. Instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>, permacomputing practices planned <a href='lasting.html'>longevity</a>, reuse and repair of existing technology and approaches waste as a resource.</p>

<p>It is telling of the age in which we live, that people will often find themselves shopping for the most-permacomputing apps to download or computers to buy. There attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs, and personalized systems to address those needs, but these are by no means "permacomputing products". Permacomputing is about finding these limits, and not their artifacts.</p>

<q>Asking for the most suitable programming language for permacomputing is akin to asking for the most suitable plant for permaculture &mdash; the entire question contradicts itself.</q>
