<h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from
permaculture.</h2>

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion
in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements
for computing even the most trivial tasks. Permacomputing is about using
computation only when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems.</p>

</ul>

<p>Its design principles encourage the maximizing of the hardware lifespan,
minimizing energy usage and focusing on the use of already available
computational resources. It values maintenance and encourages the refactoring
of systems to keep them efficient, instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned
obsolescence</a>, permacomputing practices <a
href='salvage_computing.html'>planned longevity</a>.</p>

<p id='disassembly'><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of
a product can be disassembled for repair and for <a href='commodity.html'>end
of life</a>. This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a
product's life cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken
apart at the end of its life so that each component can be reclaimed. </p>

<q>That which cannot be repaired is already broken.</q>

<p>Among other shifts in thinking and making, this means minimizing materials,
using simple mechanical fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling
components with their material type, and ensuring components can be
disassembled with everyday tools. Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a
<i>sustainable</i> product, designing a product for disassembly is a more
concrete, quantifiable approach to ecologically sound making and to
consumption. See

<h3>Articulating the Value of Absence</h3>

<p>There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs,
advised by the concepts of permacomputing, and personalized systems to address
those needs, but there are no permacomputing products. Permacomputing is
concerned about finding these limits, and <b>not their artifacts</b>.</p>

<img src='../media/generic/permacomputing.png' style='float:left; margin-right:30px'/>
<p>Computation is intrinsically <b>self-obviating</b>, which is to mean that the
computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less necessary
to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to provide for
their own welfare.</p>

<q>Asking for the most suitable programming language for permacomputing is akin
to asking for the most suitable plant for permaculture &mdash; the entire
question contradicts itself.</q>
