<h2>A holistic approach to computing and sustainability inspired from permaculture.</h2>

<p>The abundance of digital storage and processing power has caused an explosion in wastefulness, which shows in things like ridiculous hardware requirements for computing even the most trivial tasks. Permacomputing aims at only using computing when it has a strengthening effect on ecosystems.</p>

<p>Permacomputing does not advocate for <i>going back in time</i>, despite advocating a dramatic decrease in use of artificial energy, but trusts in human ingenuity to finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition into co-operation, and <a href='solarpunk.html'>waste into resources</a></p>

<h3>Articulating the value of absence</h3>

<p>Computation in this context is intrinsically self-obviating, which is to mean that the computational system, by design, tries to make itself less and less necessary to the realization of its purpose, and gradually allow people to provide for their own welfare.</p>

<p>It values maintenance and encourages the refactoring of programs to keep them efficient, instead of counting on Moore's law to compensate for <a href='stack.html'>software bloat</a>. Instead of <a href='commodity.html'>planned obsolescence</a>, permacomputing practices planned <a href='lasting.html'>longevity</a>, reuse and repair of existing technology and approaches waste as a resource.</p>

<p>It is telling of the age in which we live, that some will find themselves shopping for the most-permacomputing apps to download or computers to buy. There are attempts at drawing a line at the edge of one's computing needs, and personalized systems to address those needs, but these are by no means "permacomputing products". Permacomputing is concerned about finding these limits, and not their artifacts.</p>

<q>Asking for the most suitable programming language for permacomputing is akin to asking for the most suitable plant for permaculture &mdash; the entire question contradicts itself.</q>
