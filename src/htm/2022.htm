	<h2>2022-09-12 We've got worlds to go to</h2>
	<p><code>16S</code> ; Finding ourselves having drinks over a scattering of world atlases and passage planning compendiums, once again.</p>

	<h2>2022-08-30 Hunger for a Way Out</h2>
	<p><code>16R</code> ; The misantropia that accompanied our return to the noise and smell of the cities, has not yet subsided. We find ourselves surrounded by people, homologous to those who happily mow the lawn at dinner time, who will break the quietude of an anchorage by running a gas generator to watch <a href='technology.html'>television</a> as the sun sets.</p>
	<p>It's no wonder that birds don't sing here, lest their songs be invariably drowned by the deafening display of the <a href='simulacra.html'>vacationers</a> broadcasting to the fourth horizon over that they are taking it easy.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Started poking at building a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/zombie' target='_blank'>little sequencer</a> again.</li>
	<li>Improved <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/drifblim' target='_blank'>Drifblim</a> to make it capable of assembling large files.</li>
	<li>Keeping <a href='https://sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/feed' target='_blank'>busy</a>, can't let the world bring me down.</li>
</ul>

	<h2>2022-08-16 Farewell Desolation</h2>
	<p><code>16Q</code> ; We've left <a href='https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html' target='_blank'>Desolation Sound</a>, and stopped in Texada to reprovision before sailing south. We finally have access to reliable internet access again, but despite my <a href='bookmarks.html'>near-endless supply</a> of things to catch up on, none of it sparks any interest in me right now.</p>
	<p>Have you ever had this feeling like all the music sounds the same? And, like all the pictures are of the same place. It seems that the whole of the web is marching to this tune that goes "Easter Time! Chocolate Time! Do all your shopping At Wal-Mart!"</p>

	<h2>2022-08-01 A Potato</h2>
	<p><code>16P</code> ; We've sailed ourselves into somewhat of an internet deadzone, where my evenings consist of lying in the hammock hung between the jib and the mast, thinking about what sort of an <a href='operating_systems.html'>operating system</a> I'd like for myself; what would be both realistic for the Uxn platform, and the limits of my own aptitude for realizing it.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Built an <a href='potato.html'>operating system</a>.</li>

	<h2>2022-07-16 Slideshow Tech 2000</h2>
	<p><code>16O</code> ; I haven't had it in me to start new projects these past two weeks, so I've instead revisited projects in need of care; namely <a href='https://100r.co/site/adelie.html' target='_blank'>Adelie</a> which was until now undocumented, leaving people to guess at how things worked. It has been nice to see some terrific projects made with it, like <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/@l3kn/108641034195971494' target='_blank'>tower of hanoi</a>, and these <a href='https://social.weho.st/@dvn/108630529793221806' target='_blank'>gorgeous</a> <a href='https://mstdn.social/@JotaEmese/108620021297292173' target='_blank'>slides</a>. It took all the restrain in the world not to turn it into another <a href='hypertalk.html'>Hypercard</a>.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a <a href='thue.html'>Thue interpreter</a>, and a tiny <a href='cccc.html'>desktop calculator</a>.</li>
	<li>Sent artwork to the second issue of <a href='https://fantomeszine.com' target='_blank'>Fantomes</a> zine.</li>
	<li>Designed a fresh <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/@neauoire/108705386563362320' target='_blank'>new bold font</a> for Orca.</li>
</ul>

	<h2>2022-07-02 Self Documenting Binaries</h2>
	<p><code>16N</code> ; The more I try to imagine what resilient software might look like, the more shortcomings I find in <a href='roms.html'>Varvara roms</a>, namely, the ones that rely entirely on external <a href='documentation.html'>documentation</a>. So, I decided to try and begin to tackle this problem by adding a menu navigation <a href='manifest.html'>manifest</a> to each one, which not only makes the application self-documenting, but also improves accessibility.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Planted soy at 50°8.549'N 124°56.972'W</li>
	<li>Wrote a macros pre-processor for <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/drifblim' target='_blank'>Drifblim</a>.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-06-19 Dwindling Stores</h2>
	<p><code>16M</code> ; I hate to think that we will, at some point, have to sail south to re-supply, we've both decided that we shall stretch our supplies for as long as we possibly can. We will soon run out of fresh produce, but we have prepared enough <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/lactofermentation.html' target='_blank'>preserves</a> to last us for months.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote our keynote for <a href='https://nime2022.org/' target='_blank'>NIME 2022</a>.</li>
	<li>Transcribed notes over to the <a href='https://permacomputing.net' target='_blank'>Permacomputing Wiki</a>.</li>

	<h2>2022-06-03 Uxntal Communication II</h2>
	<p><code>16L</code> ; We've arrived in Desolation Sound and met up with friends. We spend the long afternoons rowing the dinghy along the shoreline and exploring the thickly forested coast. I went ahead and assigned a glyph to each Uxn opcode, to make an <a href='uxntal_alphabet.html'>Uxntal Alphabet</a>, it adds a wonderful conlang aspect to the project. I'm hoping to turn this into a little graphical assembler at some point.</p>

<article>
	<h2>2022-06-01 Uxntal Communication I</h2>
	<p><code>16K</code> ; I just couldn't stop thinking about a potential <a href='uxntal_reference.html'>Uxntal Sign Language</a>. So, Rekka and I began assigning hand gestures to numbers, operators and modes. I'm also thinking that I might like to assign glyphs so an assembler that does away with English altogether could be envisioned.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxnlin' target='_blank'>linter</a> for Uxntal, and implemented <a href='https://wiki.c2.com/?TailCallOptimization' target='_blank'>tail-call optimization</a> to uxnasm.</li>
	<li>Planted lentils, mung beans and radishes at 50°8.527'N 124°40.195'W</li>

	<h2>2022-05-30 Heading North</h2>
	<p><code>16J</code> ; We are finally making our way north toward Desolation Sound and the Broughton Archipelago. We are spending these late spring days anchored between high mountains, revisiting ideas for projects we had conceived of this last winter, but decided to leave for a later time. I've been fascinated by how an entire computing paradigm can emerge from the primitives of combinatory logics, my recent thoughts have been populated by these <a href='logic.html'>strange talking birds</a>.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented an <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/ornithologics' target='_blank'>ornithologics</a> playground.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-05-14 Slides rules</h2>
	<p><code>16I</code> ; Aquired a couple of <a href='slide_rule.html'>slide rules</a> from a retired teacher, and figured out how to use them, my plan is to gift them to people we meet in our travels. I've spent the better part of the week plotting shapes on paper with the help of the slide rule, while also experimenting with a <a href="turquoise.html">line-plotting engine</a>, inspired from <i>Turtle Graphics</i>, for creating procedural graphics.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Released a <a href='nebu.html'>spreadsheet program</a>, which fits neatly in a 6kb rom.</li>
	<li>Wrote a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn5" target="_blank">HTML5 implementation</a> of UxnVM.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-04-30 Uxn Specs</h2>
	<p><code>16H</code> ; I felt frustrated by the development of Uxn this week. I was thinking back on the creation of Orca, especially about the period when the last few operators were being finalized. A handful of livecoders and myself were already using it as the remaining rough edges were still being figured out. I recall people in the chatroom who would raise hell each time operators were moved around. Looking back, I'm glad that I didn't freeze the specs then, or Orca would not have its current operators and symmetries, I had to remind myself of that.</p>

	<h2>2022-04-14 Bedrock Failure</h2>
	<p><code>16G</code> ; Inspired from the <a href="http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2015004_cuneiform.pdf" target="_blank">Cuneiform Tablets</a> paper, I considered realizing the paper's point of implementing <a href='https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/989' target="_blank">Smalltalk72</a> on a UVM, I spent a few days experimenting with the ST72 environment &mdash; Only to realize that, like the <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~rabbits/b23e80eaf675c1b704bc704577e503cfd0d8f474" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a>, it is poorly thought out and fundamentally irreconcilable with <i>smol computing</i>.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a plain <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11" target="_blank">X11 implementation</a> of Varvara.</li>
	<li>Created an Uxntal REPL, called <a href='bicycle.html'>Varvara's Bicycle</a>.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-03-30 FSF</h2>
	<p><code>16F</code> ; We gave our talk at <a href='https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/libreplanet-living-liberation-day-two-retrospective-and-motivation-for-freedom' target="_blank">LibrePlanet 2022</a>, and it went very well. During the Q&A, we talked about living without a fridge, from food preservation to <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sprouting.html' target="_blank">sprouting</a>, and we were delighted to see so many people interested in that stuff. I guess the intersection of computers and gardens is slightly larger than I thought. </p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Played a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1eC8czDAkk' target="_blank">little set</a> for Algorave's 10th anniversary.</li>
	<li>Revamped Orca, Nasu, and Left to support Varvara's new Screen/Auto port.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-03-14 Digital Preservation</h2>
	<p><code>16E</code> ; Took a deep dive into the various experiments in digital preservation(PADI, CAMiLEON, Domesday, etc..), didn't really find anything worthy of note, but it did inspire me to rewrite some of the content on <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a>. I've also spent the past couple of days improving <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, and adding support for <a href="tga_format.html">tga</a> images.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a little single-file Uxntal assembler called <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-02-30 A Dice Game</h2>
	<p><code>16D</code> ; Rekka is putting the finishing touches to <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>, and asked me to design a game that the people of Iridi could be playing. I thought a dice game combining the capture mechanism of Go and the randomness of the Domino draw might be a good fit, learn to play <a href='hako.html'>Hako</a>.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBTzswUmzY' target='_blank'>J & Y wiring</a>, in the Uxn port of Orca.</li>
	<li>Wrote a version of <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/minesweeper' target='_blank'>minesweeper</a> for Varvara.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-02-14</h2>
	<p><code>16C</code> ; Our upcoming keynote for <a href='https://www.fsf.org/news/artist-collective-hundred-rabbits-to-keynote-libreplanet-living-liberation' target='_blank'>Libre Planet 2022</a> has been announced, we've built a little <a href='adelie.html'>slideshow program</a> for the presentation. I've revamped the <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> documentation and added a <a href='orca_reference.html'>reference page</a>, as well as fixing a few bugs in the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy' target='_blank'>Uxntal implementation</a>. Toying with wireworld sucked much of my time, again.</p>
</article>

<ul>
	<li>Finally, brought back incoming links at the bottom of wiki pages. They had been gone since the migration from C, to Uxntal.</li>
</ul>

<article>
	<h2>2022-01-30 Tamagochi</h2>
	<p><code>16B</code> ; Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a Serbian and Polish translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/wireworld' target="_blank">wireworld</a>. Ah! Also, <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> turned one year old.</p>
</article>

	<h2>2022-01-14 Devlog Start</h2>
	<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the Uxn project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>second one</a> is about a personal computer and the <a href='potato_devlog.html'>last one</a> will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>
