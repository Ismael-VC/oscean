<h2>2022</h2>

<p><code>16D</code> ; Rekka is putting the finishing touches to the <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a> novel, and asked me to design a game that the people of Iridi could be playing. I thought a dice game combining the capture mechanism of Go and the randomness of the draw of Domino might be a good fit, learn to play <a href='hako.html'>Hako</a>.</p>

<p><code>16C</code> ; Our upcoming keynote for <a href='https://www.fsf.org/news/artist-collective-hundred-rabbits-to-keynote-libreplanet-living-liberation' target='_blank'>Libre Planet 2022</a> has been announced, so we built a little <a href='adelie.html'>slideshow program</a> for the occasion. I've revamped the <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> documentation and added a <a href='orca_reference.html'>reference page</a>, as well as fixing a few bugs in the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy' target='_blank'>uxntal implementation</a>. Toying with wireworld sucked much of my time, again.</p>

<p><code>16B</code> ; Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a Serbian and Polish translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='wireworld.html'>wireworld</a>. Ah! Also, <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> turned one year old.</p>

<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the <a href='uxn.html'>uxn</a> project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the second one will be about the varvara computer and the last one will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>
