<h2>2022</h2>

<p><code>16F</code> ; We gave our talk at <a href='https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/libreplanet-living-liberation-day-two-retrospective-and-motivation-for-freedom' target="_blank">LibrePlanet 2022</a>, and it went very well. During the Q&A, we talked about living without a fridge, from food preservation to <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/sprouting.html' target="_blank">sprouting</a>, and we were delighted to see so many people interested in that stuff. I guess the intersection of computers and gardens is slightly larger than I thought. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Played a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1eC8czDAkk' target="_blank">little set</a> for Algorave's 10th anniversary.</li>
	<li>Revamped Orca, Nasu, and Left to support Varvara's new Screen/Auto port.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16E</code> ; Took a deep dive into the various experiments in digital preservation(PADI, CAMiLEON, Domesday, etc..), didn't really find anything worthy of note, but it did inspire me to rewrite some of the content on <a href='permacomputing.html'>permacomputing</a>. I've also spent the past couple of days improving <a href='noodle.html'>Noodle</a>, and adding support for <a href="tga_format.html">tga</a> images.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote a little single-file uxntal assembler called <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16D</code> ; Rekka is putting the finishing touches to the <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a> novel, and asked me to design a game that the people of Iridi could be playing. I thought a dice game combining the capture mechanism of Go and the randomness of the Domino draw might be a good fit, learn to play <a href='hako.html'>Hako</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implemented <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIBTzswUmzY' target='_blank'>J & Y wiring</a>, in the Uxn port of Orca.</li>
	<li>Wrote a version of <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/minesweeper' target='_blank'>minesweeper</a> for Varvara.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16C</code> ; Our upcoming keynote for <a href='https://www.fsf.org/news/artist-collective-hundred-rabbits-to-keynote-libreplanet-living-liberation' target='_blank'>Libre Planet 2022</a> has been announced, we've built a little <a href='adelie.html'>slideshow program</a> for the presentation. I've revamped the <a href='orca.html'>Orca</a> documentation and added a <a href='orca_reference.html'>reference page</a>, as well as fixing a few bugs in the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca-toy' target='_blank'>uxntal implementation</a>. Toying with wireworld sucked much of my time, again.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added incoming links to Oscean.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>16B</code> ; Rekka and I completed <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a>, our entry for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam 2022</a>, we also added a Serbian and Polish translation to <a href='thousand_rooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. When I wasn't playing with <a href='primes.html'>primes</a>, or <a href='reading.html'>reading</a>, I was noodling in <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/wireworld' target="_blank">wireworld</a>. Ah! Also, <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> turned one year old.</p>

<p><code>16A</code> ; To kick off 2022, I've decided to write 3 documents for the Uxn project, in which I'll save my design notes, the <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>first one</a> is about the virtual machine itself, the <a href='varvara_devlog.html'>second one</a> is about a personal computer and the last one will be a simple operating system. Hopefully, by the end of this year, this project will have have matured into something that is more easily definable.</p>
