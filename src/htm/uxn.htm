<h2>Uxn is a virtual machine with 32 instructions.</h2>

<img src='../media/generic/uxn.png' width='200' style='float:right'/>

<p>This <b>one-page computer</b> is capable of hosting small <a href='roms.html'>applications</a>, programmable in a unique <a href='uxntal.html'>language</a>. It was designed with an <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>implementation-first</a> mindset with a focus on creating portable tools and games.</p>

<p>This <a href='about.html'>wiki</a> and most of the audio-visual works documented on here were created with Uxn-powered tools.</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>

<p>Uxn has no registers. It can tunnel through 127 subroutines and find its way back. Up to 16 devices can interface with the CPU at once; devices are peripherals such as screens, controllers, or even other <i>uxns</i>. It has 64kb of observable memory, programs can move stacks into addressable range to allow reading and writing directly into stack memory.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Because Uxn was explicitly created to be hosted on <a href='permacomputing.html'>pre-existing hardware</a>, the design was advised primarily by relative software complexity; generating novel electronics is at odds with the project. Features were weighted against the relative difficulty they would add for programmers implementing their own emulators.</p>

<p>Stack-machines are ideal candidates for this scale of personal computing. Not only do they limit the complexity of the assembler, the resulting programs are succinct and translate well to <a href='paper_computing.html'>pen & paper computing</a>.</p>

<p>With only 64kb of memory, it will never run Chrome, TensorFlow or a blockchain. It sucks at doing most modern computing, but it’s also sort of the point. It's more about finding what new things could be made in such a small system.</p>

<p style='background: #eee; padding: 15px;'>While this project aspires to act as a platform that may last, it is in its infancy, the design may change and break compatibility.</p>

<h2>C Implementation</h2>

<p>The VM is implemented in about 100 lines of <a href='ansi_c.html'>ANSI C</a>, it lives at the core of the <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara computer</a>. Uxn is to Varvara, what the 6502 is to the Classic Nintendo.</p>
