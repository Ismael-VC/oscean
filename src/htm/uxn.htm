<h2>Uxn is a virtual stack-machine.</h2>

<img src='../media/generic/uxn.png' width='200' style='float:right'/>

<p>This <b>one-page computer</b> is capable of hosting, programmable in <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a>, was designed with an <a href='uxn_devlog.html'>implementation-first</a> mindset and a focus on creating portable <a href='roms.html'>graphical tools and games</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href='about.html'>wiki</a> and most of the audio-visual works documented on it were created with Uxn-powered tools.</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>

<p>Uxn utilizes two stacks, allowing it to tunnel through 127 subroutines and find its way back. It can interface with up to 16 devices at once; devices are peripherals such as screens, controllers, or even other <i>Uxns</i>. Each instance has its own stack and device memory, but share a common 64kb of memory with the others.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>Because Uxn was explicitly created to be hosted on <a href='permacomputing.html'>pre-existing hardware</a>, the design was advised primarily by relative software complexity; generating novel electronics being at odds with the project. Features were weighted against the difficulty they would add to programmers implementing their own emulators.</p>

<p>Stack-machines are ideal candidates for this scale of personal computing as one can comfortably write programs directly in assembly to tackle most computation projects without having to rely on higher-level languages.</p>

<p>With only 64kb of memory, it will never run Chrome, TensorFlow or a blockchain. It sucks at doing most modern computing activities. It's more about finding novel things that can be made in such a restricted system.</p>

<p style='background: #eee; padding: 15px;'>While this project aspires to act as a target that may last, it is in its infancy, the design could still change and break compatibility.</p>

<p>The VM can be implemented in about <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11/blob/main/src/uxn.c' target='_blank'>100 lines of C</a>, it lives at the core of the <a href='varvara.html'>Varvara computer</a>. Uxn is to Varvara, what the 6502 is to the Classic Nintendo.</p>
