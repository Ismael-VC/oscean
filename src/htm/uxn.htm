<h2>Uxn is a virtual stack-machine.</h2>

<img src='../media/generic/uxn.png' width='200' style='float:right'/>

<p>This <b>one-page computer</b>, programmable in <a
href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a>, was designed with an <a
href='uxn_devlog.html'>implementation-first</a> mindset and a focus on creating
portable <a href='roms.html'>graphical tools and games</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href='about.html'>wiki</a> and most of the audio-visual works
documented on it were created with Uxn-powered tools.</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>Uxn utilizes two stacks, allowing it to tunnel through 128 subroutines and
find its way back. It can interface with up to 16 peripherals, such as screens,
controllers, or even other <i>Uxns</i>. Each instance has its own stack and
device memory, but share a common 64kb of addressable memory with the
others.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture'
target='_blank'>instruction set</a> has 32 stack-machine opcodes, and 4
immediate opcodes, that can be implemented in about <a
href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11/blob/main/src/uxn.c' target='_blank'>100
lines of C89</a>. The Uxn virtual machine is to <a
href='varvara.html'>Varvara</a>, what the 6502 is to the Famicom. If you're
interested in implementing your own emulator, here are some resources to get

<p style='background: #eee; padding: 15px;'>While this project aspires to act as
a target that may last, it is in its infancy, the design could still change and
break compatibility.</p>

<p>Because Uxn was explicitly created to be hosted on <a
href='permacomputing.html'>pre-existing hardware</a>, the design was advised
primarily by relative software complexity; generating novel electronics being
at odds with the project. Features were weighted against the difficulty they
would add to programmers implementing their own emulators.</p>

<p>Stack-machines are ideal candidates for this scale of personal computing as
one can comfortably write programs directly in assembly to tackle most
computation projects without having to rely on higher-level languages.</p>

<p>With only 64kb of memory, it will never run Chrome, TensorFlow or a
blockchain. It sucks at doing most modern computing activities. It's more about
finding novel things that can be made in such a restricted system.</p>
