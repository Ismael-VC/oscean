<table border='1'>
	<tr><th><code>LET</code></th><td>a=expt</td><td>Assigns the value of the expression to the variable.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>PRINT</code></th><td>expr</td><td>Prints the values of the expressions and/or the contents of the strings in the console.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>GOTO</code></th><td>expr</td><td>Changes the sequence of program execution.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>GOSUB</code></th><td>expr</td><td>Changes the sequence of program execution, and remembers the line number of the GOSUB statement, so that the next occurrence of a RETURN statement will result in execution proceeding from the statement following the GOSUB.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>RETURN</code></th><td></td><td>Transfers execution control to the line following the most recent unRETURNed GOSUB.  If there is no matching GOSUB an error stop occurs. </td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>IF THEN</code></th><td></td><td>The IF statement compares two expressions according to one of six relational operators.  If the relationship is True, the statement is executed; if False, the associated statement is skipped.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>END</code></th><td></td><td>The END statement must be the last executable statement in a program.  Failure to include an END statement will result in an error stop after the last line of the program is executed.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>REM</code></th><td>comment</td><td>Permits comments to be interspersed in the program.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>CLEAR</code></th><td></td><td>Formats the user program space, deleting any previous programs. If included in a program the program becomes suicidal when the statement is executed.</td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>RUN</code></th><td>expr</td><td>Used to begin program execution at the lowest line number. If the RUN statement is directly executed, it may be followed by a comma, followed by values to be input when the program executes an INPUT statement. If the RUN statement is included in a program with a line number, its execution works like a GO TO first statement of the program. </td></tr>
	<tr><th><code>LIST</code></th><td>from-to</td><td>Causes part or all of the user program to be listed. If no parameters are given, the whole program is listed. A single expression parameter in evaluated to a line number which, if it exists, is listed. If both expression parameters are given, all of the lines with line numbers between the two values are listed inclusively.</td></tr>
