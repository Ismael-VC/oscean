<h2>A little bed for the Playdate</h2>

<p>I made a simple sleeve to protect the <a href='playdate.html'>Playdate</a>,  from a single piece of canvas 13cm x 28cm sown over itself into a pocket, with a piece of webbing 13cm long in-between. This size gives just enough space to hold both the Playdate and its cable. The webbing holds the flap down.</p>

<p>I've used boatshrink water resistant canvas with UV resistant thread, but only because it's what we had left over from projects we did on the boat.</p>
