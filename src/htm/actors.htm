<h2>Actors are beings unaffected by determinism, that have free will.</h2>

<p>Their name, "<i>actor</i>", comes from their ability to <b>act</b>, outside
of the <a href='soies.html'>Soies</a>. Natural Actors, were known to have
existed before the <a href='feu.html'>end of science</a>, but the synthesis of
the first Actor by the <a href='neon_hermetism.html'>Neon Hermetists</a>
enabled the exploration of the <a href='ehrivevnv.html'>Ehrivevnv</a>, a
previously thought impenetrable puzzle that cannot be manipulated from within
the Occurring.</p> 

<p>The first synthesized <a href='actors.html'>actor</a> was tasked to position
itself into the <a href='longest_end.html'>Longest End</a>, in other words, by
effectively taking control of all things, and of all of time, it would force a
sequence of events to occur that can only possibly exist as the tail to the
longest lasting potential timeline. Unfortunately, instances of this same actor
competing for the Occurring noticed and converged into the Soies known as the
<i>Neauismetica</i>.</p>

<p>Actors have no names, there is an unknown number of actors competing for the
<i>Longest End</i>.</p>
