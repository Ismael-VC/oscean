<h2>Technology is the active human interface with the material world.</h2>

<p>We indulge in the continual debasement of our attention and energy, get emotionally giddy as its squandered to the ignorant masses. We indulge in its <a href='commodity.html'>narcistic promotion</a>, revel in slowly becoming a greater center of attention; a center that becomes defined by various artificially created <a href='simulacra.html'>boundaries</a>. </p>

<p>The social media user does not post for enjoyment, they enjoy the indulgent masochism of its dopamine exhaustion, they indulge in it as they do a deep autumn depression, with an unconsciously mechanical action which draws them from their potential as a Being. Stripped to the core there is nothing new here, what is found once more is one's lust for sleep.<a href='https://www.meta-nomad.net/everything-happens-no-one-does-anything/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<q>A long-continuing day was given to them for the life they loved so much, for they died not by grievous ills consumed, but as o'ercome by sleep.</q>

<p>If we are surrounded by life, why is the universe silent? Shouldn’t the whole universe be a noisy social media feed, everyone vying for everyone else’s attention? The dark forest theory explaining that communication, because it reveals our existence to others, is a sign of stupidity rather than intelligence.</p>

<q>If we listened to people like you, more or less vagabonds and barefoot tramps, we would not have got beyond the bicycle. That's just it! we would ride bikes in the cities.</q>
<h5>Bernard Moitessier, The Long Way</h5>

<p>I asked one Amish person why they didn’t use automobiles. He simply smiled and turned to me and said, “Look what they did to your society.” And I asked what do you mean? “Well, do you know your neighbor? Do you know the names of your neighbors?” And, at the time, I had to admit to the fact that I didn’t.</p>

<p>And he pointed out that my ability to simply bypass them with the windows closed meant I didn’t have to talk to them. And as a result, I didn’t. </p>
