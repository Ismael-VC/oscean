<h2>Immediate opcodes</h2>

<p>Immediate opcodes are operations which do not take items from the stack, but <i>immediately</i> after the opcode in the program memory. Uxntal has 4 immediate opcodes: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>literal</b> opcode <kbd>LIT</kbd>.</li>
	<li>The <b>jump cond</b> <kbd>?routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JCN</kbd>.</li>
	<li>The <b>jump</b> <kbd>!routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JMP</kbd>.</li>
	<li>The <b>jump subroutine</b> <kbd>routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JSR</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The immediate jump opcodes are slightly faster, and easier to write, than their standard counterparts, but cannot be used to do arithmetic and do not have modes. They are written by prefixing a label name with the opcode's rune:</p>
