<h2>Immediate opcodes</h2>

<p>Immediate opcodes are operations which do not take items from the stack, but read values stored <i>immediately</i> after the opcode in the program's memory. Uxntal has 4 immediate opcodes: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>literal</b> <kbd>LIT</kbd>.</li>
	<li>The <b>jump</b> <kbd>!routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JMP</kbd>.</li>
	<li>The <b>conditional</b> <kbd>?routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JCN</kbd>.</li>
	<li>The <b>subroutine</b> <kbd>routine</kbd>, immediate of <kbd>JSR</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The immediate jump opcodes are slightly faster than their standard opcode counterparts, but do not have modes and cannot be used to do stack arithmetic. The address value of the immediate opcodes are stored in memory as relative shorts, enabling routines making use of these opcodes to be moved around in the program's memory.</p>

<p><b>Quoting</b> is the act of <a href='https://limited.systems/articles/uxntal-quoting/' target='_blank'>deferring an operation</a>, for example, a program that does either <code>odd()</code> or <code>even()</code>, could use <kbd>JMP2</kbd> to <i>unquote</i> a function pointer passed via the stack.</p>
