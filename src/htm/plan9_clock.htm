<h2>Updated the look of the Plan9 clock.</h2>

<p>I wasn't <i>really</i> into the whole baby blue clock, also in it not displaying seconds, so I've fixed it up a bit. It now displays each second on the clockface, and use hairline thin lines drawn through the Bresenham algorithm. The style is designed to align with the <a href='plan9_color.html'>Plan9 Color Picker</a>. This project is a good simple demonstration of <a href='plan9_c.html'>Plan9 C</a>.</p>
