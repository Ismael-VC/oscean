<h2>Capitalism Fascism Reactionism Fuck Off!</h2>

<p>Because of the decentralized nature of some of my work, this has to be
spelled out quite clearly: Preparing for impending apocalyptic events should
mean <b>collective action and structural reform</b>, not individualism and
isolation.</p>

<p>I am committed to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and
racial supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and
its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and
ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary.
To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking. <a

<p>I am aggressively opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism,
ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power
structures of all kinds.</p>

	<p>The Three Arrows symbol used by anti-fascist anarchists originated from the
Social Democratic Party of Germany to mean "neither Stalin's slaves nor
Hitler's henchmen" and was designed to be stenciled over swastikas. It
represents the different types of authoritarianism that should be opposed:
Reactionaries, Fascists & Authoritarian Socialists. </p>
