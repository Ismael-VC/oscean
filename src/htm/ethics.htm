<h2>Capitalism Fascism Reactionism Fuck Off!</h2>

<img src='../media/refs/nonazi.png' style='float:left; margin-right:30px; margin-bottom: 15px;'/>

<p>Because of the decentralized nature of some of my work, this has to be spelled out quite clearly: Preparing for impending apocalyptic events should mean <b>collective action and structural reform</b>, not individualism and isolation.</p>

<p>I am committed to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking. <a href='https://blood-and-dust.com/politics/' target='_blank'>~</a></p>

<p><img src='../media/refs/fem.png' style='float: right;width: 100px;margin-left: 20px;'/>I am aggressively opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power structures of all kinds.</p>
