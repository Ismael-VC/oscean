<h2>Humans are not the point and purpose of the planet.</h2>

<p>We will face this reality honestly and learn how to live with it. We realize that the current and upcoming crises cannot be reduced to a set of problems in need of <a href='technology.html'>technological</a> or political solutions. We believe that the roots of the current and upcoming crises lie in the stories we have been telling ourselves.</p>
<p>We're destroying the world because we are, in a very literal and deliberate way, at war with it. People need more than to be made to feel stupid and guilty. They need more than a vision of <a href='collapse.html'>doom</a>. They need a vision of the world and of themselves that <a href='solarpunk.html'>inspires them</a>.</p>

<p>There is nothing new, everything has been done, all philosophic and social theoretical issues have been addressed, and all that is left is to recycle, recombine, and play with these in new ways. </p>
