<h2>The Playdate is a monochromatic handheld console, programmable in C.</h2>

<p>A Playdate was donated to <a href='hundred_rabbits.html'>Hundred Rabbits</a> by <a href='https://tendigits.space' target='_blank'>Nate Steiner</a>, our interest in the device was to see if we could turn it into a host machine for <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>.</p>

<p>The device is the result of a collaboration between Teenage Engineering, a company who makes boutique electronics and Panic, a company who writes proprietary development software for the platform that most aggressively fights against the Right To Repair.</p>

<p>But, despite that, it's surprisingly easy to open the Playdate and replace its standard 740mAh battery, all is needed is a slotted screwdriver. We did not receive our pre-sale unit with a disassembly manual nor the tools to open the case, but such third-party manuals exist.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>The PlayDate documention focuses on building Lua projects using either VS Code or X Code, we will setup a <a href='ansi_c.html'>plain C</a> project without relying on an IDE.</p>

<p>You need to install the <a href='https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/arm-none-eabi-gcc/' target='_blank'>GNU cross compiler for ARM EABI(bare-metal)</a> to be able to make arm compatible binaries. It should include <code>libnewlib-arm-none-eabi(arm-none-eabi-newlib)</code> which is also needed.</p>

<p>We'll simply use <code>make</code> as opposed to the ninja/cmake toolchain suggested in the official documentation. For an example project, you can have a look at the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-playdate/tree'>Uxn Emulator</a>.</p>
