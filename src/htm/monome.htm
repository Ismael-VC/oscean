<h2>The Monome is an open-source controller, each of its 128 keys can light up between 16 levels of brightness.</h2>

<p>I presently use the device for audio & visual experiments under the <a href='alicef.html'>alicef</a> alias, ultimately I would like to carry the <a href='monome.html'>monome</a> and the <a href='norns.html'>norns</a> along with me on stage during events.</p>
<p>I created a handful of scripts for the device, such as the implementations for the <a href='https://github.com/neauoire/linn' target='_blank'>Linnstrument Keyboard layout</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/neauoire/rack' target='_blank'>Ableton Drum Rack layout</a>.</p>
