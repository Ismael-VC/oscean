<h5>â€”Blaise Pascal, The Provincial Letters</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
	<li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
	<li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
	<li>Never use a foreign or scientific word, if you can think of an English equivalent.</li>
	<li>Never use a figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</li>
	<li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
</ul>
