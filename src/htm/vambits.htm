<h2>Vambits are small DIY desktoys designed to be laser cut in acrylic.</h2>

<p>The critters were initially created as <a href='drownspire.html'>Drownspire</a>, in collaboration with <a href='https://www.ponoko.com' target='_blank'>Ponoko</a> but is now produced by our friends at <a href='https://twitter.com/skogrstudio' target='_blank'>Sk√≥gr Studio</a>.</p>
<p>The templates are free and open-source if you want to create your own faces and custom accessories! Send us <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vambits' target='_blank'>your pictures</a> if you do.</p>
<p>The design was later stolen and sold by various resellers on Esty and designer-toys boutiques in Australia.</p>
