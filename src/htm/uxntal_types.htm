<h2>Typed uxntal is an inference system based on stack effect definitions.</h2>

<p><a href='type_systems.html'>Type inference</a> in <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a> is done by checking the stack effect declarations of words, against the sum of stack changes predicted to occur based on the items in their bodies.</p>

<ul>
	<li><kbd>( a -- b )</kbd> Untyped</li>
	<li><kbd>( a -: b )</kbd> Typed routine</li>
	<li><kbd>( a -> b )</kbd> Typed vector</li>
</ul>

<p>Words that do not pass the stack-checker are generating a warning, and so essentially this defines a very basic and permissive type system that nevertheless catches some invalid programs and enables compiler optimizations. </p>

<pre>
@routine ( a b -: c ) <i>Ok.</i>
	MUL
JMP2r
</pre>

<h3>Basic Validation</h3>

<p>The simplest case is when a piece of code does not have any branches or recursion, and merely pushes literals and calls words. Pushing a literal has stack effect <code>( -- x )</code>. The stack effect of most words is always known statically from the declaration.</p>

<pre>
@add ( <b style='color:red'>a*</b> b* -- c* ) <i>Warning: Imbalance in @add of +2</i>
	DUP2 ADD2
JMP2r 
</pre>

<h3>Return-Stack Passing</h3>

<p>The following example shows some extra syntax where stack elements passed through the return stack are prefixed with a backtick:</p>

<pre>
@wcpy ( src* des* -: cap* ) <i>Ok.</i>
	STH2
	&w ( src* `des* -: cap* )
		LDAk STH2kr STA
		INC2r INC2 LDAk #20 GTH ?&w
	POP2
	( cap ) #00 STH2kr STA
	INC2r STH2r JMP2r
</pre>

<p>Each jump label must be defined for a routine's body to validate with the arity checker, but labels can also be used anywhere in a routine to test against a specific arity in time, like you would a breakpoint.</p>

<h3>Fall-through Type</h3>

<p>The tail-less fall-through comment allows to validate a routine that does not return, by including the stack effect of the following routine in memory.</p>

<pre>
@falling ( a b c -: c ) <i>Ok.</i>
	POP
	( >> )
@next-routine ( a b -: res )
	ADD
JMP2r
</pre>
