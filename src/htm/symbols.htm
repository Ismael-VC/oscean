<h2>Symbol files are debug information about an assembled rom.</h2>

<p>A symbols(*.sym) file contains a series of absolute addresses(2 bytes) and null-terminated strings. They are generated by Uxntal assemblers, such as <a href='drifblim.html'>Drifblim</a>, and are used by debugging tools, such as <a href='beetbug.html'>Beetbug</a>, which do not otherwise have access to a program's label.</p>
