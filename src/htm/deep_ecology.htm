<h2>An environmental philosophy which promotes the inherent worth of all living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs.</h2>

<h3>deep ecology</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The well-being of human and nonhuman life on earth is of intrinsic value irrespective of its value to humans.</li>
	<li>The diversity of life-forms is part of this value.</li>
	<li>Humans have no right to reduce this diversity except to satisfy vital human needs</li>
	<li>The flourishing of human and nonhuman life is compatible with a substantial decrease in human population.</li>
	<li>Humans have interfered with nature to a critical level already, and interference is worsening.</li>
	<li>Policies must be changed, affecting current economic, technological and ideological structures.</li>
	<li>This ideological change should focus on an appreciation of the quality of life rather than adhering to an increasingly high standard of living.</li>
	<li>All those who agree with the above tenets have an obligation to implement them.</li>
</ul>
