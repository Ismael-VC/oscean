<h2>Expressions in a point-free language denote functions, and the
juxtaposition of expressions denotes function composition.</h2>

<p>The point-free programming paradigm is where function definitions do not
identify the arguments on which they operate. Instead the definitions merely
compose other functions, among which are combinators that manipulate the
arguments.</p>
