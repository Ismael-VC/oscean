<h2>The Sublime refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.</h2>

<p>I am a citizen of the most beautiful nation on earth. A nation whose laws are harsh yet simple, a nation that never cheats, which is immense and without borders, where life is lived in the present. In this limitless nation, this nation of wind, light, and peace, there is no other ruler besides the sea.</p>
