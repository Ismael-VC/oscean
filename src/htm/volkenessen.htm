<h2>Volkenessen is a multiplayer physics-based fighting game.</h2>

<p>Players start with 9 attached items on their back, and the goal is to strip the other player of their items.</p>
<p>When items are removed, they clutter up the playing area, making it even more chaotic and hilarious. The washing machine and sink in the background can also fall and bounce around!</p>
<p>Winning game of the Montreal edition of the Global Game Jam 2012, Volkenessen is a 2D Fighting game developed by <a href='http://theinstructionlimit.com/' target='_blank'>Renaud Bedard</a> and myself.</p>

<p>To hit the other player, you need to get close to him by hitting away from him, then hit him by moving away from him. Ramming into the opponent just doesn't do it, you need to throw punches, and depending on the impact velocity, even that might not be enough. You can throw double-punches to make sure you land a solid hit and take off an item.</p>
