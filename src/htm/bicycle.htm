<h2>Bicycle is an interactive Uxntal playground.</h2>

<p>Bicycle is a little playground to learn and experiment with <a href='uxntal.html'>Uxntal</a>. It's designed to allow someone to write programs in a non-destructive environment, and iterate on routines while being able to see the state of the computer change in real-time.</p>

<p>It is currently only supported by the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn11' target='_blank'>Uxn11</a> emulator, as it requires the System Device's wst/rst ports. This project also includes a terminal version of Bicycle, called Unicycle. More details shortly, you can follow its development <a href='https://merveilles.town/web/statuses/108103480084070637' target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
