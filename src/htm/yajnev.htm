<h2>The death of Yajnev engulfed Vetetrandes in an opaque impenetrable
lock.</h2>

<p>Yajnev was an <a href='actors.html'>actor</a> who's will was
localized. Its nervous system dictated localy occuring events, as well as the
course of Time. Anyone approaching Yajnev was effectively vaporized and assimilated
into the tendrils of Yajnev's thoughts.</p>

<p>The space, and time, surrounding the corpse of Yajnev is still haunted by
echoes of its reflexion and thoughts. The effect of <a
href='andes.html'>Andes</a> entering <a href='dinaisth.html'>Dinaisth</a> is
likely to have caused the collapse of Yajnev forcing a new event into the <a
href='soies.html'>Soies</a>.</p>
