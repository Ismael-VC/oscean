<h2>Ternary numbers are a base 3 numeral system.</h2>

<p>Base 10 is famously well suited to those of us who count on our fingers. Base
2 dominates computing technology because <a href='binary.html'>binary</a>
devices are simple and reliable, with just two stable states on or off. The
cultural preference for base 10 and the engineering advantages of base 2 have
nothing to do with any intrinsic properties of the decimal and binary numbering
systems.</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th>Truth value</th><th>Unsigned</th><th>Balanced</th></tr>
	<tr><td>false</td><td>0</td><td>-</td></tr>
	<tr><td>unknown</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>truth</td><td>2</td><td>+</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Base 3, on the other hand, does have a genuine mathematical distinction in
its favor. By one plausible measure, it is the most efficient of all integer
bases; it offers the most economical way of representing numbers as it is
closer than binary to the most economical radix base(2.718) to represent
arbitrary numbers, when economy is measured as the product of the radix and the
number of digits needed to express a given range of values.</p>

<p>While you can see at a glance whether a binary number is even or odd by
looking at the last digit, it is subtler with ternary in which a numeral
represents an even number if the numeral has an even number of 1s. </p>

<h3>Balanced Ternary</h3>

<p>The digits of a balanced ternary numeral are coefficients of powers of 3, but
instead of coming from the set {0, 1, 2}, the digits are {-, 0 and +}. They are
<i>balanced</i> because they are arranged symmetrically about zero.</p>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th colspan="2">Unsigned</th><th colspan="2">Balanced</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Dec.</th><th>Tern.</th><th>Tern.</th><th>Dec.</th></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>00</td><td>--</td><td>-4</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>01</td><td>-0</td><td>-3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>02</td><td>-+</td><td>-2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>0-</td><td>-1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>00</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>12</td><td>0+</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>20</td><td>+-</td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>21</td><td>+0</td><td>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8</td><td>22</td><td>++</td><td>4</td></tr>

<p>Arithmetic is nearly as simple as it is with binary numbers; in particular,
the multiplication table is trivial. Addition and subtraction are essentially
the same operation: Just negate one number and then add. Negation itself is
also effortless: Change every N into a 1, and vice versa. Rounding is mere
truncation: Setting the least-significant trits to 0 automatically rounds to
the closest power of 3.</p>

<q>Perhaps the prettiest number system of all is the balanced ternary notation.</q>
