<h2>An abstract machine intended as a target for functional programming language
compilers.</h2>

<p>The SECD is a stack-based runtime with a core of 10 opcodes defined with a set
of transitions between its four components. Functions take their arguments from
the stack. The arguments to built-in instructions are encoded immediately after
them in the instruction stream. If <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd> are both
empty, overall evaluation has completed with the result on <kbd>S</kbd>. </p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Stack</b> <kbd>S</kbd> register points to a list of intermediate results.</li>
	<li><b>Environment</b> <kbd>E</kbd> register points to the current environment.</li>
	<li><b>Control</b> <kbd>C</kbd> register points a location in the program.</li>
	<li><b>Dump</b> <kbd>D</kbd> register points to a list of triples. Each triple contains snapshots of the stack, environment, and control registers.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
( LAMBDA ( X ) ( ADD ( QUOTE 1 ) X ) )
</pre>

<p>If we compile the <a href='lisp.html'>Lisp</a> program above, the
<code>.secd</code> representation of the incrementing lambda program is as
follows in which each number is one of the abstract machine opcode:</p>

<pre>
( 3 ( 2 1 1 ( 0 . 0 ) 15 5 ) 4 21 )
</pre>

<p>If we decode the operation numbers to their mnemonics:</p>
<pre>
( LDF ( LDC 1 LD ( 0 . X ) ADD RTN ) AP BRK )
</pre>

<table border='1'>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Basic Instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>0</th><th>NIL</th><td>Pushes a nil pointer onto the stack</td></tr>
	<tr><th>1</th><th>LD</th><td>Pushes the value of a variable onto the stack. The variable is indicated by the argument, a pair.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>2</th><th>LDC</th><td>Pushes a constant argument onto the stack</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Non-recursive function instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>3</th><th>LDF</th><td>Takes one list argument representing a function. It constructs a closure (a pair containing the function and the current environment) and pushes that onto the stack.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>4</th><th>AP</th><td>Pops a closure and a list of parameter values from the stack. The closure is applied to the parameters by installing its environment as the current one, pushing the parameter list in front of that, clearing the stack, and setting C to the closure's function pointer. The previous values of S, E, and the next value of C are saved on the dump.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>5</th><th>RTN</th><td>Pops one return value from the stack, restores S, E, and C from the dump, and pushes the return value onto the now-current stack.</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Recursive function instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>7</th><th>RAP</th><td>Works like a p ap, only that it replaces an occurrence of a dummy environment with the current one, thus making recursive functions possible</td></tr>
	<tr><th>6</th><th>DUM</th><td>Pushes a "dummy", an empty list, in front of the environment list.</td></tr>
	<tr><th colspan='5'>Branching instructions</th></tr>
	<tr><th>8</th><th>SEL</th><td>Expects two list arguments, and pops a value from the stack. The first list is executed if the popped value was non-nil, the second list otherwise. Before one of these list pointers is made the new C, a pointer to the instruction following s e l sel is saved on the dump.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>9</th><th>JOIN</th><td>Pops a list reference from the dump and makes this the new value of C. This instruction occurs at the end of both alternatives of a sel.</td></tr>

<p>Like all internal data-structures, the stack is a list, with the <kbd>S</kbd>
register pointing at the list's head. Due to the list structure, the stack need
not be a continuous block of memory, so stack space is available as long as
there is a single free memory cell. Even when all cells have been used, garbage
collection may yield additional free memory. </p>

<p>The current variable environment is managed by the <kbd>E</kbd> register, which
points at a list of lists. Each individual list represents one environment
level: the parameters of the current function are in the head of the list,
variables that are free in the current function, but bound by a surrounding
function, are in other elements of E.</p>

<p>The <kbd>C</kbd> register points at the head of the instruction list that will
be evaluated. Once the instruction there has been executed, the pointer is pointed at
the next instruction in the list. It is similar to an instruction pointer (or
program counter) in conventional machines, except that subsequent instructions
are always specified during execution and are not by default contained in
subsequent memory locations, as is the case with the conventional machines.</p>

<p>The <kbd>D</kbd> register, at whose head the register points, is used as
temporary storage for values of the other registers, for example during
function calls. It can be likened to the return stack of other machines. </p>
