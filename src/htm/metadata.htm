<h2>Metadata exposes additional information about a Varvara rom.</h2>

<p>An external program can find the location of a ROM's metadata, by forming a 16-bit address from the second and third bytes of a rom file. That program can verify that this is indeed a valid address by reading the subsequent 3 bytes which should <b>always</b> be <code>80 f0 37</code>.</p>

<p>If supported by the emulator, writing the metadata's address to the <a href='varvara.html'>#f0 device</a>, via <code>#f0 DEO</code>, informs the emulator of the metadata's location, and so it may choose to handle this information to name the window, or display an icon when a ROM is started.</p>

<pre>
|0100
	;meta #f0 DEO
</pre>

<p>A Varvara ROM is able to store certain information about itself, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>name</b>: application name</li>
	<li><b>version</b>: release id</li>
	<li><b>description</b>: what it is</li>
	<li><b>author</b>: who built it</li>
	<li><b>icon</b>: a 64x64 pixels monochromatic graphic</li>
</ul>

<p>The metadata format begins with the address of the end of the metadata block, followed by the address of the appicon (an <a href='icn_format.html'>8 by 8 tiles icn</a>), and finally four zero-terminated strings:</p>

<pre>
@meta =&end =appicon
	( name ) "Catclock $1
	( version ) "Ver. 20 "4 $1
	( details ) "tic 20 "tac 20 "cat 20 "clock $1
	( author ) "Hundred 20 "Rabbits 20 7f 20 "2022 $2
	&end
</pre>

<p>The metadata is stored in the rom itself as to allow the rom program to reuse this information internally.</p>
