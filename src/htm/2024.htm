	<h2>2024-01-26 Back to music</h2>
	<p>I've originally started looking into virtual machines to build a target to
host some games, a handful of tools and my wiki &mdash; but instead of stopping
once I had done so, I kept pushing further and became obsessed with this
programming language design stuff, but along the way, I lost track of why I was
even doing it all in the first place. After a two year detour, I look back and
I've almost totally ignored my previous passions as a digital artist and
musician. I've missed writing music and drawing, it's about time I find my way
back. </p>

	<h2>2024-01-13 Maintenance</h2>
	<p>The forge that we use at Hundred Rabbits has been <a
href='https://status.sr.ht' target='_blank'>taken down by DDoS attacks</a> and
is struggling to come back online, the event reminded us that we ought to also
have mirrors and release versions of these source files available elsewhere. I've begun
to host copies across our various websites. The builds are still
accessible through <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io'
target='_blank'>itch.io</a>.</p>
	<p>Until we regain access and release the changes of the last few days, keeping
with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use I've taken a
moment to write a kind of <i>pocket version</i> of the console emulator and <a
href='drifblim.html'>self-hosted assembler</a> as to see how many lines are
needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket
emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have
been <a href='uxn.html'>added to the wiki</a>.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, if anyone is looking for a specific file that is currently
unavailable, get in touch!</p>

		<li>Enjoyed watching the mini series <a href='https://archive.org/details/effondrement-collapse-2019'>L'Effondrement(2019)</a>.</li>
		<li>Thankful for Sourcehut's tireless work on <a href='https://status.sr.ht' target='_blank'>resolving the issue and communication</a>.</li>
