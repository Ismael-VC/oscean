	<p>The forge that we use at Hundred Rabbits has been taken down by DDoS attacks
and is struggling to come back online, the event reminded us that we ought to also have

the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use I've taken a moment
to write a kind of <i>pocket version</i> of the console emulator and
self-hosted assembler as to see how many lines are needed to start from the
seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket emulator, the source for
the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have been <a
