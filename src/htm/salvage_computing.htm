<h2>Figuring out how to make the best possible use out of the millions of
devices which already exist.</h2>

<p>Salvage computing believes that the end of a computer product's lifecycle
should be seen as a moment of celebration, a moment when its socioeconomic
context can finally be reclaimed. Scavenge-friendly electronics are parts that
are no longer manufactured, but that are available by the billions in
landfills. Those who can manage to create new designs from scavenged parts with
low-tech tools will be able to preserve electronics.</p>

<p><b>Designing for Disassembly</b> ensures that all elements of a product can
be disassembled for repair and for <a href='commodity.html'>end of life</a>.
This allows for and encourages repairs, with the result that a product's life
cycle is prolonged; and it allows for a product to be taken apart at the end of
its life so that each component can be reclaimed. Among other shifts in
thinking and making, this means minimizing materials, using simple mechanical
fasteners instead of adhesives, clearly labeling components with their material
type, and ensuring components can be disassembled with everyday tools. </p>

<q>That which cannot be repaired is already broken.</q>

<p>Unlike the nebulous goal of designing a <i>sustainable</i> product, designing
a product for disassembly is a more concrete, quantifiable approach to
ecologically sound making and to consumption. <a

<p><b>Emulation</b> is a way of preserving the functionality and access to
digital information which might otherwise be lost due to technological <a
href='obsolescence.html'>obsolescence</a>. One of the benefits of the emulation
strategy compared with migration is that the original data need not be altered
in any way. It is the emulation of the computer environment that will change
with time. </p>

<p>A <b>universal virtual computer</b> needs to be well documented, contain a
bare minimum of functionality, be easily testable for compliance, and have
very, very few special cases in the specification, since special cases are
opportunities for incompatibility; but despite that, it needs to be a
reasonable target to write a compiler for. Finally, I argue that a UVC ought to
have predictable performance.</p>

<q>Wait. What nostalgia? This is not about reliving fond memories or fetishize
about an <a href='pastoral.html'>imaginary past</a>, it's about being tactical
in our choice of medium, so as to propagate a political perspective
efficiently.<a href="https://iodinedynamics.com/whatkind.html"
